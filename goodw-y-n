<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu, and I'll also be your host. In every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn more about their practice and motivations.</p>
  <p>And in this episode, I am so grateful to be speaking with and sitting with GOODW.Y.N. GOODW.Y.N. creates performances that are born out of their lived experience as a queer Black person trying to survive in the United States. A celebrated poet and spoken word artist, GOODW.Y.N. lyrically transforms past moments of trauma into acts of deliverance.</p>
  <p>They have said that performing allows them to exist beyond the daily pain for short periods of time. Having performed across the United States, often in public spaces, GOODW.Y.N. challenges passersby to contend with their humanity and acknowledge the pain GOODW.Y.N. has experienced. I have followed their work for several years here in New York, so it is so special for me to be speaking with GOODW.Y.N. today.</p>
  <p>Welcome to the podcast.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: I'm excited to be here. I just can't… I can't get enough of this. I'm a big fan of the Open Studios Podcast anyway, and being on it is just like a thrill. So I'm really excited.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I think I want to begin just with this first rather simple question. Could you tell me a little bit about…what has your journey been to becoming a performance artist and how has your practice been informed by your work as a poet and a writer?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Wow. That's a deep question. You're really diving right in. I would say that my journey has been up and down, left and right, all in circles and back to the start. I think finding myself has been a part of the journey and a part of what “Ain't I a Woman” has been to me for the last six years.</p>
  <p>And it is. It's definitely influenced by my poetry, by my writing, but it's also the surrendering of the body, just the surrendering of self into the unknown and the nothingness that is the unknown and coming back from it a different person each time. So I want to say that I'm taking all of me into a focal point through the body and then…yes, going into the void and coming out a different person.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Are you surrendering your body to the unknown, as you said, or is it surrendering your body to, particularly when you're performing in public spaces, the unknown of how other people will receive you, will respond to your presence in a public space? Who or what are you surrendering your body to?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: There is a vulnerability, but it also is surrendering to the audience. This is my womanhood. This is my vulnerability. This is my softness. And being that in public is a strong statement, but it also is surrendering to the audience and saying, “Do with it as you will, but I am still permanent. I am here and that can't be erased.”</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: When I think back to the title of the piece, right…so “Ain't I a Woman is a reference to or is titled after Sojourner Truth's 1851 speech of the same name. When I've seen performances of Ain't I a Woman, they unfold as these durational rituals that involve your nude body and are often defined by specific props or repetitive movements or gestures.</p>
  <p>For example, in 2017, when you did a performance of this work in Greenwich Village, you had the words, “Ain’t I a Woman?” written across your body and you move through various statuesque poses. And then in a 2019 performance at the Satellite Art Show at SXSW, you rubbed pancake mix on your body until it was fully enveloped in the white cakey powder.</p>
  <p>And then in a 2020 performance at Smack Mellon, you slowly covered yourself in baby powder, coconut oil, red liquid, and chains near a torn American flag. And I know you've done various other iterations of this work at other locations as well, too. And I guess I'm curious, how did you first develop “Ain't I a Woman?” And how do you trace or relate it to Sojourner Truth?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: First of all, let's start with Sojourner Truth and the factualities of it. With Sojourner Truth, the speech, “Ain't I a Woman,” is actually “Aren’t I a Woman?” It was converted from “Aren’t I a Woman?” to “Ain't I a Woman?” - from Northern speak to Southern speak. With that in mind, it was a white woman who did it. She wasn't even at the speech. And it came out several years later from the original speech.</p>
  <p>What I wanted to do was reclaim the speech and what it's done to us and what it's done to our bodies. Much of the work that I did after that was about anti-Blackness, especially the pancake powder.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, I want to say that much of it was by accident. It was a serendipitous thing because I was struggling in a workshop that I attended. It's called EmergeNYC. It's still going strong. I love it. And I support it 110%. And I was in it in 2017 and I was struggling to transition from poetry to performance art.</p>
  <p>I remember one of the proctors at the time, Ed Woodham, told me to challenge myself. And I went home, and the next day I was in the shower, believe it or not, and I saw this vision of me. [I saw myself] naked in the street with the words, “Ain't I a woman” written all over my body - bare breasted and all. And then I go back to the cohort and I tell them, well, this is what I saw.</p>
  <p>And they were all for it. Like 19 people were cheering for me to do this project. And it was a scary moment because at the time I was battling for custody for my daughter from the state. So it was challenging.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I think by placing yourself in a situation where you're performing, as you said, bare breasted, and you are confronting people who would otherwise view you as being invisible because of your Blackness, because of your queerness, because of the totality of who you are. And you're saying, “No, I am here. I'm placing my body here and you will look at me and you will be forced to contend with my presence here. And you have to recognize me.” And so I'm curious, what have you learned about yourself or unearthed about yourself as you've revisited “Ain’t I a Woman?/!” over the years in different spaces?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: I learned a great deal. I discovered that fear is a living thing and it lives in the body just as much as the breath does. I was very much afraid or am still afraid of growing older and becoming obsolete. I'm afraid of being untethered. I confront that fear through “Ain’t I a Woman?/!” and body performance because I am very much out there - out there in the distance, on the edge of a precipice. So I have to be this ultra-magnification of self. I have to bring heaven into my body and create a safe space.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I'm just sitting with those words “I have to bring heaven into my body” and thinking about the physical experience of that. And then I'm also thinking about that juxtaposed with the reality of, you know, the spaces that you've performed in, where you've often been met with violence, right? And anger.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Both in and outdoors, there have been forms of violence against my person.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: How do you maintain your haven when confronted by those acts of violence? And yes, how do you persist and endure in performing?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: I just see it as my duty to keep going. I see it as my duty to persist. In the face of adversity, I look at my life and the legacy that I'm trying to build, especially for my daughter…persistence and tenacity is necessary in order to keep going through life.</p>
  <p>“Life will be life-ing” as my friend, Wanda Ortiz (Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz rather) had said. Life will be life-ing. And I think of legacy a lot in terms of my child. But also in terms of what are we leaving generations? And that sounds like a heavy burden, but it really isn't. It's necessary work. And that's what drives me: the fact that it's necessary.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And so, in that way, all of your work, all of your performances exist as an act of protest, an act of fortifying or extending legacy as a way of ensuring your survival, too, I think. Maybe it's fighting for your safety, fighting for security in a world that often denies that or tries to deny that to you.</p>
  <p>The fact that you faced so much violence and vitriol from audiences, both indoors and outdoors… Why do you think people are afraid or angered by witnessing your work?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: It turns to anger because anger is the only restitution that allows them to do something. Secondly, I will say that I try to focus on the celebration of my work that really fortifies against the anger. There's this wave of support, especially from young people, young black women that I've gotten support from, and other POC and even white women and men of younger generations have celebrated my work.</p>
  <p>But I would say that the reason why anger and vitriol is added to the flame is because there is this need to erase Black bodies, whether it was over the boats during the Transatlantic slave trade or in private white spaces where Black bodies are threatening the status quo and threatening the trend of systemic racism.</p>
  <p>Simultaneously, [white supremacy] is a lie you build up in your head and you fundamentally feed it while creating it. So it is its own god. When we reach into defying that existence of something and that evil and that wicked, there is no other retort but violence because it is - it is the last bastion of something so cruel and so ignorant; it’s a system based off of ignorance. And it has to resort to the most brutal form to crush rebellion. So what I stand for is rebellion against the system just with my Black body. That's what I've been doing for the past six years.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I think of the images that I've seen of you sitting outside Trump Tower, which is the symbol to me of white supremacy, and of the spoils of capitalism and excess.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Yes. Yes. Yes.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And you sitting there… and I think of celebration, channeling that defiance, that rejection, that rebellion, and it's been a beautiful thing to witness. Thank you.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Trump Tower was work. Trump Tower was the first time that “Ain't I a Woman” had become work. I remember being there and the presence had given me a headache, a migraine.</p>
  <p>We, as a group, could feel the tension that did not want to be deescalated. To activate a space and say my Black body is standing against this ground of colonization, of economic capital, at its fiercest and most evil presence was work. I had to find a lot of fortitude to do that. And yeah, I'm very proud of that piece.</p>
  <p>I'm very proud of the Trump Tower edition. Very proud of it.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Thinking ahead to your next performance of “Ain't I a Woman,” which will be happening in a few weeks…I was just wondering, could you tell us a little bit about your upcoming performance of “Ain't I a Woman, The Dinner Party Part II”?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: It is hard to say these words, but I love good endings.</p>
  <p>I love good beginnings to a narrative, but I especially love good endings. And it is the final iteration of “Ain't I a Woman?/!”  I'm closing it out after six years. It's a lot of anniversaries. It's the Black August anniversary where Trump Tower happened, but it's also the revisiting of Judson Memorial Church where I performed the Dinner Party in the first place (Part I. And now I’m returning and creating a protest party. I am very relieved and happy to go back to Judson with this gift to the people [and] with this gift to myself and say, “Ain't I a Woman?/!” is leaving on time.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: It will be.</p>
  <p>Something else I noticed about the title, too, that I wanted to ask you…</p>
  <p>The original title, when people reference Sojourner Truth's speech, it ends in a question mark. So it's essentially this interrogative statement or maybe a rhetorical question. Aren't I a woman, but really, of course, I am a woman.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Yes.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: But in all of your iterations of “Ain't I a Woman ?/!”, you also have an exclamation point.</p>
  <p>You have both the question mark and the exclamation point.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Yes.</p>
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I just wanted to ask, what does the exclamation point signify for you?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Existence and presence. It is a question or was a question that became a battle cry of defiance. And saying, “I am here, I am present, I am existing, whether you like it or not. So you're in my way.”</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I just love that. I love it.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: I get a thrill out of it. I get a thrill out of it.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And so you mentioned that this upcoming August performance of “Ain't I a Woman?/!” will be the final performance in that series. What are some other ideas either for writing or poetry or other performances that you have marinating right now in your head?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Oh, wow. So I have tons. First of all, I want to say I'm working on my first documentary film, and it's going to be basically about the world of performance art, the avant garde, the experimental, the ups and the downs, the losses and the gains of performance art in my life and in the lives of other women and queer individuals.</p>
  <p>That's one project. Then I have several written projects. I'm working on a new poetry collection called Humans that is inspired by other forms of art, particularly music. Believe it or not, I'm on Threads like damn near every day writing new poems for Humans.</p>
  <p>These poems are really good. I enjoy them. They're really upbeat, but they're not sappy. They really take on a different role outside of the harsh realism that I've lived and the harsh reality that I've had to adopt. So once again, I'm adopting defiance, but without anger. This is more injecting hope. So, that's what the project of Humans is.</p>
  <p>Also, I am working on different performances around the country. And of course, for written work, I'm also working on a manifesto called Privacy, Please. And its sister book is How to Live Underground. So I'm very excited about those.</p>
</div>

<div class="host-info">Asia Stewart, podcast host.</div>
<div class="guest-info">GOODW.Y.N., podcast guest.</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Your comments around poetry make me think of a quote of yours that I actually found. This was from a post that you wrote for Culture Push a few years ago.</p>
  <p>You wrote, “The very nature of poetry itself is to not only quest for goodness in the world, but to conjure it where it is needed.” So I wanted to ask if that still feels true to you.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Oh, yeah. That means so much to me to celebrate the things that not only didn't kill us, but the things that didn't break us. To transform is how we survive.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Back in 2022, you participated in an audience talk back at Haverford College, and you said, “I perform in order to evoke, but I can't tell you how to feel. I can't give you that answer and say, what is the contract, because I'm not entertaining you.” And so I'm curious, what is the traditional contract that you think has existed between performers and audiences? And how are you trying to upend that contract?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: The mammification, especially of Black women and large Black bodies, to answer everything, to be at the beck and call of private white spaces and individuals in order to solve what they can't ruminate on...Again, this goes back into the myth and the mythos of systemic racism. So it mutates and splits and becomes something similar and different at the same time. And I let it be known, I am not here to entertain the problem of racism and answer it for you when I didn't even create it, nor do I feed it. So being outright bold and spitting in that eye a little bit is the only answer I have left.</p>
  <p>Because I am 42 going on 43 and my patience is worn thin; my patience is worn out, actually. And I refuse to give something so repugnant a stage to share with me. No, you cannot have that. Not for me. Not ever again. Find it yourself. Dig deeper and find the answer yourself.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I think also your comments remind me of a history of Black entertainers and performers feeling as though they needed to make their body and their presence and their performance something that could be easily digestible by a white audience or that could make it so they could be easily consumed by a white audience or to just to make them laugh, to make them chuckle and to the point where they were the butt of the joke. If that makes sense?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: But that goes for Black audiences as well who tolerated that form of placement. So whatever we tolerate..the poison we tolerate compared to the violence we're trying to escape…</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Before we close, I want to also just look back at one other quotation of yours that I've really loved. And so this was something that I've taken from a 2022 interview with Zachary Frater.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: I stated that I'm a fat Black woman. For some, they really didn't know what to do with that. And I thank Zach every day for having the courage to keep my words as is and not edit them.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: The quotation that I was drawn to from that piece is, you said, “The ability to bear skin and breast and bone in public gives you a laissez faire attitude. You just stop giving a shit.”</p>
  <p>I love this reference to your new laissez faire attitude. And so I guess in closing, how is this attitude informing the way that you move through the world or informing the way that you approach making new work?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Yes. Oh, it's making me take a lot of chances. And I am inspired to keep going through the wilderness and see what I'll find. So, I'm in the wilderness. I am a voyager into the wilderness, an explorer into the nothing and discovering myself.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Well, I am just very happy to. Live in the same city as you, GOODW.Y.N. To be able to witness your work and to just be in community with you is so wonderful because you truly are such a special person and artist.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.:Thank you.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: You're such an inspiration for me.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>GOODW.Y.N.: Thank you so much. Likewise. Likewise. Thank you so much.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Thank you so much for joining me on this podcast today, GOODW.Y.N.. It's been such a pleasure speaking with you and I am so excited to see “Ain't I a Woman, The Dinner Party Part II” in a few weeks.</p>
