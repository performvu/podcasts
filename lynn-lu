<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu. I'll also be your host. In every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn more about their practice and motivations. And in this episode, I am so delighted to be speaking with Lynn Lu.</p>
  <p>Lynn embraces participation and collaboration in her performances, making space for the development of intimacy and connections with people that the constraints and isolating nature of our world don't typically allow for. Having earned her BFA from Carnegie Mellon University with a major in Sculpture, an MFA in New Genres from the San Francisco Art Institute, a PhD (ABD) from Musashino Art University in Tokyo and a PhD from the University of Newcastle in Australia, Lynn weaves together training from a number of disciplines to create dynamic performances, installations, and immersive experiences.</p>
  <p>There is a vulnerability that Lynn offers to audiences and participants in one on one performances that, in turn, encourages the expression of honest, often suppressed or hidden emotions. Lynn's installations and performances are deeply engaging, often activating a range of sensory interactions, including touch and taste.</p>
  <p>Her work gives audiences the license to participate in actions that may feel forbidden, strange, and absurd.</p>
  <p>Welcome, Lynn. How are you feeling today? How are you doing?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: Really good. Thank you so much for having me, Asia.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Your work as an artist is prolific. You've produced so many performances and installations over the past two decades. And one through-line that I see through your incredibly large body of work is the fact that you rarely let audiences passively experience your work or your performances.</p>
  <p>And that your performances often require this level of touch and interaction. Why do you think you've consistently built that into your work or into your performances, into the conditions of your performances?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: I'm interested in engaging my audiences in active collaboration, so that they themselves determine to some degree the content of the work and sometimes even the outcome of the work, because I'm interested in people and in their agency as audiences. And, of course, my predecessors include Marina Abramović and Valie Export, and I really admired their work because they radically redefined the concept of audience participation.</p>
  <p>And they did this by offering an open situation to their spectators to do with their works what they would. And so building upon and extending that strategy, I try to make works whose meanings manifest in the empathetic identification and responses of my audiences.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I guess there's also this element of trust that you build into your performances as well.</p>
  <p>Because you're giving audiences license to maybe access your body or to touch you or to interact with you in different ways. There's the trust that you have in them [the audience] in permitting them to do so. And then also for an audience member as well, for a participant, a viewer, anyone who's really engaging with your performance to also trust that they'll be held perhaps appropriately by engaging with you in different ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: Thanks. Yeah. I've always, I've been interested for a long time in engaging very intimately with strangers. And you mentioned in one of your notes earlier about consent and how that is navigated on my part and it is so relevant in interactive work. I've never actually had an experience where I felt violated, except in one work that was a remote piece made during Covid where one participant behaved in an unexpected way.</p>
  <p>So this work was called “skinship: a communal bath” where five participants at a time were invited to join me in an hour-long bath on Zoom. With each of us in our respective bathtubs, I led some exercises and readings relating to the physical isolation caused by the pandemic, and bringing the corporeal back into our remote interactions, and the age-old practice of communal bathing, and how we can add the pleasure of sociability to the daily task of cleaning ourselves.</p>
  <p>So anyway, all the participants, across the sessions over a number of days, positioned their cameras at face level so that all that we saw of each other was just head and shoulders. And then there was this one guy who positioned his camera high and at a good distance so that his entire nude body was on full display with his limbs splayed out, so that we had an unobscured view of his genitals.</p>
  <p>He probably was just a nudist who randomly came across this festival online and said, “Oh great, let's all get naked together.” Because he seemed clearly puzzled with what was actually going on in the bath, and I was on the verge of asking him to reposition his camera out of consideration for the others because we're not there to look at each other's bodies, when he just kind of exited the Zoom without saying anything. And then he directly messaged me asking if I was offering any other nude activities. And this creeped me out, so I blocked him.</p>
  <p>I've had a participant withdraw their consent during an interactive performance many years ago when I was still a young artist. And, at the time, I had been mostly concerned with specific questions that I posed to myself in the form of these participatory performances and I was mostly concerned about the answers that I got from my participants through their experience. I was less interested in how the experience was for participants themselves.</p>
  <p>And I remember being surprised at the time by how open and how generous my audiences were, how they would respond to my requests. And sometimes I would request quite personal things or quite intimate things or stories from them.</p>
  <p>And because I was young and foolish, I didn't quite understand the importance or really the gravitas of strangers trusting me in these ways. And one participant in this work called “lojong” felt that I betrayed his trust and trivialized his trauma and walked out of the performance.</p>
  <p>And just to briefly let you know what this piece was about, the Lojong is a Tibetan Buddhist meditation in which one just is putting oneself in the shoes of another person as a way to expand compassion.</p>
  <p>And I wanted to do this literal exercise of Lojong in which I invited participants one at a time to tell me about the most traumatic experience of their lives, and then I promised to return a parallel account of my own experience. And then I sliced a wedge of lemon and put it in my mouth and sucked on it while I listened to their story.</p>
  <p>And when they had finished sharing their story, I cut them a fresh wedge of lemon, put it to their mouths, and then proceeded to tell their narrative back to them in the first person as much in their own words as I could remember.</p>
  <p>So, in my mind, the thing that makes horrible experiences so much worse is that on top of everything else, it makes you feel or makes me feel desperately alone, and it can feel like no one else in the world could possibly know what we're going through.</p>
  <p>So, I wanted the performance to offer the suggestion that, while the causes of our suffering might be different and will be very different, the pain that we endure is very much shared. And while some of my audiences did find the experience strangely therapeutic in the way that I had hoped, at least one person absolutely did not. He walked out and also told me off when he walked out, which I felt very sorry about.</p>
  <p>But since then I became hyper-aware of precisely what it is that I ask of my audience. And how I protect their trust in me and crucially I ensure that I offer them something of equal value so that the exchange between us feels fair.</p>
  <p>So that if the work asks a lot of the participants, then the experience for them must be gratifying to them in equal measure as far as I can predict.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I'm just thinking of some of your earlier performance works, like “strawberrymilkbath” or “The kissing booth” or “smack/smooch” involves this direct like physical touch or engagement with an audience and perhaps the trajectory to later works which involve, I think, more of like a verbal exchange or sharing of one's story, one's history, one's lived experience.</p>
  <p>How do you track the evolution of your performance work over time?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: Yeah, so because I've made work for a really long time, my concerns and interests have changed so much. So, “strawberrymilkbath”was one of the earliest performances I made in which I bathed in a tub of strawberry milk and invited audiences to drink out of it using straws or cups.</p>
  <p>And that was very much a direct response to the theme of the exhibition, which was a group show about pink works. Because in graduate school, for some reason, a lot of people were making, a lot of painters in particular, were using pink, the pigment. And so, it was a direct response to that.</p>
  <p>And it was kind of a, almost a tongue-in-cheek kind of experiment to see what would happen. And also because I travel a lot and [have] lived in lots of different countries and cities, I realized very quickly that the way I was seen varied very widely.</p>
  <p>So, for example, in Asia, I was not ever seen as beautiful. For example, I was told repeatedly in my youth, you know, how ugly I was. And, you know, I was in fact so ugly that I must have been picked up from the skip, you know, like things like that.</p>
  <p>But then in France, I was seen as something very exotic, you know, and people would approach me in the streets to tell me how beautiful I was, well, you know, really strange things like that.</p>
  <p>And when I moved to America, I found that I was liked. I felt liked, more liked than anywhere I'd ever lived for no special reason. I just felt that people really liked me, which made me think of the very strange American saying, “I like you so much, I'll drink your bathwater,” which to me was so bizarre. And so I felt like I needed to put this to the test to see if Americans really liked me enough to drink my bathwater.</p>
  <p>So that was just a kind of an early experiment. And as for the later works, you know, when I was working on my PhD, when I was in Japan, I was a student of Buddhism. And I was really interested in a lot of Buddhist theory, which was very abstract and very hard for me to…I didn't quite understand how to relate to them on a day-to-day basis.</p>
  <p>And so a lot of the performances in those years were experiments or questions…that I was asking myself, you know, about how would this work in real life, you know, how would this work in my daily life? And so the performances came out of that inquiry in which the participation of the audiences would be some sort of answer to me.</p>
  <p>So the form of the performances, it was never kind of conscious. It was never a conscious strategy to make performances in any kind of particular form. They just kind of took the form that made the most sense at the time.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: In the questions that you ask or the prompts that you offer, you're opening up a space or even a line of thinking that people wouldn’t normally engage in or wouldn't allow themselves to engage in on a regular day to day basis.</p>
  <p>I'm thinking of “walking a mile.” This is another one of your earlier works in Thailand where you inspired a crowd of strangers to suddenly silently exchange their clothing with one another, which is something you would never see otherwise.</p>
  <p>There's this space of empathy and understanding of seeing that there are other people like you or being able to engage with people who are different from you too.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: Empathy is definitely an ongoing kind of concern and it was kind of the basis of my PhD thesis and what I researched for many years. I was trained as a sculptor in my undergrad and as an artist who produces physical objects.</p>
  <p>There's always the issue of storage, as you might know. And so I moved around a lot in my twenties, you know, cities, countries, and continents, and really felt burdened by my possessions, including my physical artwork, a lot of which I had to bin because I just couldn't carry them around or sell them or water them. You know, not everybody wanted artwork.</p>
  <p>So, by the time I was in grad school, I was seriously questioning the validity of art-making itself, especially art objects. And the thought of being personally responsible for adding more clutter to the world was really disturbing to me. So disturbing that my art production actually came to a standstill and was completely…I couldn't make anything for some months.</p>
  <p>And in the midst of this dilemma, this American artist, Charles Long, visited my university to give an artist talk, and he shared his experiences when he was a young artist with similar doubts. And how, at some point, he came to see his artwork simply as stuff taking up space in the world and thought to himself that unless he could create something that he would never put in the trash, he would quit being an artist altogether, which was exactly how I was feeling about my work.</p>
  <p>And so, Charles Long set himself the task of coming up with something or making an object so special that he could never throw it away. And what he eventually came up with was this blob of plaster in which he embedded small mirrors, so that when a spotlight was thrown on it from a specific angle, it would reflect the word “special” behind it. And so he could never throw it away.</p>
  <p>And at the time I was reading A Lover's Discourse by Roland Barthes, and I was really struck by his comparison of friendship to what he called a space of “total sonority,” where the friend, the perfect interlocutor, constructs around us the greatest possible resonance.</p>
  <p>So, resonance refers to the intensification and enrichment of sound by sympathetic vibration. So, for example, there's some stringed instruments like a sitar that has only three strings that are meant to be played, but scores of other strings that are never meant to be played, and they exist only to vibrate with the three strings that are played to enrich the sounds that are produced.</p>
  <p>And so anyway, I became curious about this phenomenon of sympathetic vibration and wondered if it could concretely exist or occur between human beings, as Roland Barthes had suggested. And through fMRI, we know that we actually do sympathetically vibrate with each other in very concrete ways.</p>
  <p>So fMRI allows us to observe and map neural activity in real time. And it shows us empirically that our brains mirror each other's actions and experiences when we observe other people experiencing something that we know from personal experience.</p>
  <p>So for example, if we have been burned in the past, when we watch someone else being burned, we not only know what that burn probably feels like, we also actually feel that burn to some degree, together with the emotions associated with being burned.</p>
  <p>[This] brought me back to Barthes, who in 1979 intuited what neuroscientists of our time would discover: that our minds mirror another's in a situation we're personally familiar with. That, as with musical instruments, resonant relationships also occur between human beings who inhabit a shared state.</p>
  <p>So, with this in mind, I set out to devise works that create resonant relationships between myself and my audiences, and also between audiences themselves. And one way to achieve this is by involving my audiences in the collaboration of the work, so that we're immersed in a situation that is made not only resonant by our mutual and first-hand knowledge of each other's experience because we're doing it together, but also made personally relevant about our joint role as co-creators.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: That's a really good question. And the answer is yes. It is much easier to engage in these very kind of intimate confession-like scenarios with complete strangers that, you know, you'll never see again. But it is with people that, you know, you will come across again and especially people that I know in a professional context [that gets challenging] because I worry that they will judge me or think differently of me. So yeah, definitely.</p>
  <p>And especially in my earlier work where I used my nude body quite often in works, it was always much easier to make these works in front of people that I had no connection with and no relationship to that I would never see again.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: There is this safety in interacting with people who are strangers. Perhaps you would assume that there would be this level of discomfort or fear, but then instead it's actually really inviting.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: There's something very safe about sharing intimate things anonymously. So when people are strangers, you're anonymous to each other. I think this phenomenon is seen quite a lot in different projects.</p>
  <p>For example, there's this online project called PostSecret, where people are invited to confess basically. Also, many years ago, before I landed on this project, I worked at the Tate Modern during a festival. The festival was called the Really Really Free Market. And so, different arts organizations were invited to give away things.</p>
  <p>And I just set up a little sign that said, “Free Secrets: take one and or leave one.” And I kind of got the ball rolling with a few of my own secrets. And people just, you know, jumped into this project so willingly; everyone was curious about the secrets. Others also have this desire…this deep desire to share their own hidden stories that they weren't unable to share or unwilling to share for whatever reason.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah. And in that situation, there is no consequence of opening up or sharing. And there's also something really exciting about the idea of encountering a secret where you have no context, you have no idea who wrote it. And there's something really exciting about that mystery of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: Yeah absolutely.</p>
  <p>And also, it is so liberating at the same time and also so comforting to come across secrets that you yourself hold. Things that you can't even allow yourself to think.</p>
  <p>For example, one of the confessions was something about [a person] telling people that they are an orphan, but in fact, they're not.</p>
  <p>So I've got the confession here. It reads, “I sometimes tell people I'm an orphan. I'm not.” And another one that reads, “I will be truly free when both my parents are dead.”</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Wow, that's quite…</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: Yeah, quite intense revelations.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Absolutely!</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: But it's not as unusual as we think, not as rare.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah. I was just thinking that you've also amassed an incredible archive then of these stories of the secrets or the tales that people have felt inclined to share with you.</p>
  <p>How do you engage with this archive now, with these notes? Do you have any plans of sharing these anonymous stories  in any way?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: I've not yet decided what to do with them. There have been some confessions that I haven't known what to do with…where the confessions are so dark and so beyond my own experience that I don't have the capacity to, to even process them.</p>
  <p>So these ones sit very uncomfortably with me. So, there were some confessions that had to do with child abuse and like pedophilia. And so that was a really shocking thing to receive, and I did not know what to do with it and I still don't.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I guess a question that I was thinking of asking you is that in many ways your body is also functioning as an archive and that your memory is almost this repository for many of these stories [and] many of these tales. And some of them are delightful and funny and humorous, but there's also the stories that are very tragic or, you know, trauma-laden or just horrific like the ones that you voiced previously.</p>
  <p>And so how do you personally try to hold or carry those stories or how have you dealt with receiving both the joyful things people want to share, but also the darker stories?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: That's a really good question and for sure the body is a repository of all of these things. I've undergone a lot of therapy, talking therapy, in my life and at some point I started to train as a psychotherapist as well.</p>
  <p>And I understood how important it was to have somebody to empty out to. So I've been careful to share these difficult things with my therapist, but I think also mostly it's a matter of compartmentalizing where I approach or I view the responses that I get as part of the project and as the result of a very specific request.</p>
  <p>And when I do get the responses, I feel, yes, this has worked and it has helped me understand this concern that I've had a little bit better, even if some of the content of what I received is difficult.</p>
  <p>But yeah, in general, I feel that I haven't been harmed necessarily by the things that have been shared with me.</p>
  <p>And I hope that I haven't harmed anyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Part of your practice is inspired by this curiosity for other people and learning about other people. This is perhaps a very broad question, but what are some of the things that you learned about yourself through engaging in these very intimate situations with other people?</p>
  <p>What have they been able to offer you as you move through the world, as you move through your life?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: Well, I'd say that maybe the first thing that I learned is that I present to the world as wholly unthreatening. People feel threatened by me in the least in the way I look, in the way I sound, in my mannerisms.</p>
  <p>I've understood very early on that audiences trust me to do them no harm, although sometimes more than they should. So for example, in the work “strawberrymilkbath,” where I bathed in the milk, I was in that tub for about four hours for the duration of the opening of this exhibition. And I made sure to clean myself beforehand so that I would be as germ free as possible for my participants.</p>
  <p>However, I did not anticipate that I would need to pee, and quite a few times,  while I was in there. And so while I felt terrible about it, there was nothing I could do about it. And I had to pee a few times.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Hmmm.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: But with people drinking out of it, now I knew that I wasn't going to poison anybody because historically humans have ingested pee to cure ailments such as ulcers and even TB. And urine therapy is found in the Bible and yogic scriptures. And it was also used by the Ancient Greeks to whiten their teeth.</p>
  <p>So, I knew that no one would come to any real harm drinking my pee. But at the same time I felt terrible about it. Until later in the evening when someone came up to me, a young man came up to me and whispered in my ear, “Did you pee in the bath?”</p>
  <p>And I had to say, “Yes, I did. I'm really sorry.” He's like, “Oh, that was what I was hoping to hear.” And then he took the milk and drank it, which made me feel a lot less bad.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: That's a funny story. But I also think from the perspective of an audience member, you are choosing to drink someone's bath water…and bath water that is strawberry milk no less.</p>
  <p>So there is, I think, an awareness. It's something that they're choosing or very much electing to do. They weren't, uh, forced in any capacity to do so or to drink the bath water. That is really funny though.</p>
  <p>I'm also just thinking of what you shared famously as well as, um, being seen as non-threatening or perhaps as, as being approachable, I guess, using that in the design of, of many of your performances and interactions to your advantage, or at least of knowing that there are people who will accept some of the prompts that you're offering.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So, as I mentioned in the beginning of our conversation, that I lived in lots of different places and in my experiences of people's reactions to me, I realized that I'm seen so differently in different contexts. And so that plays very much into the works that I make in different contexts also.</p>
  <p>So, for example, in a place where I am seen as an exotic Other, I fully play up to this exotic Other and fully exploit people's expectations.</p>
  <p>So, I made a work in Munich where I seemed to be telling the fortune of people, so they could throw these coins in the I Ching method.</p>
  <p>And I would go to the page of the I Ching book and appear to be translating their fortune to them. But in fact, what I was doing was giving everyone an identical fortune, which was the most positive of all the fortunes from the I Ching book, from the original I Ching. But all the most positive ones, which I had memorized and then told it to the participants as if it was their unique fortune.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: As we move to close Lynn, are there any things that we haven't touched on yet that you'd want to share?</p>
  <p>Also, what are some of the things that you're looking forward to in your work, and in your life that you'd like to leave us with?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: So, I'm currently experiencing a very intense perimenopause and this started in the beginning of the year. And in the process of trying to survive my perimenopause, I've inadvertently become an expert in the perimenopause and in HRT, which is currently saving my life because it's enabling me to sleep some nights.</p>
  <p>And so this is my main preoccupation. Now, I'm working on a new project thinking about perimenopause and menopause and collecting stories from my family about the women that had menopause. [I am] trying to understand for myself what this period of life has meant.</p>
  <p>Historically, a lot of women actually didn't make it past menopause. There's a percentage of women, actually a very large percentage of women, who have such difficult symptoms that their lives come to an end or they take their own lives.</p>
  <p>This asylum in the UK in London, called Bedlam. The most common cause of being admitted to this Bedlam Asylum was a change of life, what was called the change of life, which is the old name for the menopause.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I think it's such a common thing that people experience, but there are very few discussions around the range of symptoms that someone would be experiencing. Or really just…those are the stories of the discomfort and the pain of it [are not shared.]</p>
  <p>I'll just be really interested to see the personal histories that you collect in that new project.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: Yeah. And, as a phenomenon, it's such a mysterious one as well, because there's no kind of evolutionary need for it, you know.</p>
  <p>There's no need for women to survive after the childbearing age and humans are the only species aside from like two species of whales that live long past the menopause.</p>
  <p>And this is a very magical thing, like why are we still alive?</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Well, I am so excited to see what that project becomes, Lynn. And I'm just so grateful for everything that you've shared, all the stories that you've shared in our conversation today, so thank you so much again for coming on to the podcast.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Lynn Lu: Yeah, thank you so much, Asia. It's been such a joy speaking with you.</p>
