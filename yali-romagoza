<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu, and I'll also be your host. Every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn a little bit more about their practice and motivations.</p>
    <p>And in this episode, I have the pleasure of sitting down with Yali Romagoza. Yali Romagoza is a Cuban born interdisciplinary artist currently based in Queens, New York. Romagoza graduated with a master's degree in fashion, body, and garment from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2016 and holds a BA in art history from the University of Havana, Cuba.</p>
    <p>Romagoza's work reflects her interest in confronting issues related to migration, diaspora, and the trauma of displacement and estrangement from home. Bridging multiple disciplines, Romagoza combines performance, installation, video, photography, and costume design. Throughout her vibrant career, Romagoza has never been afraid to challenge art institutions or interrupt public space with unsanctioned performances.</p>
    <p>Welcome, Yali. How are you doing today?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: I'm good. Thank you for having me.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Of course, of course. And are you speaking currently from your studio at EFA? Or are you somewhere else right now?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Right now, I am from my home. Because I have a long day and...there's been a lot going on, so I'm not from the studio today.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Okay, okay. Amazing. And how have you been settling into the studio?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: It's been quite incredible. I remember the time that you went and we had like this brief meeting. Nothing was on the walls and now everything is up and it's exciting. I've been receiving visits from people and it's been really incredible to reflect on these past 10 years.</p>
    <p>And having a conversation through my process of making the art that I'm doing now and this body of work that is so powerful and intense for me to share and to see like every day. It's really weird, but exciting.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: And to be reminded of it every time you walk into your studio and to almost be confronted by it constantly in the space.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: I know. It is, it is quite shocking, but also it's very… I've been very emotional because, you know, you do the performance, but then not all the time you have the chance to reflect on the piece in a different way. Like, documentation can be so many things, right? And there are so many elements that go, at least in my performance, go from costume, the transformation of my body when I become Cuquita the Cuban Doll, and all those objects can also, express the moment when I did the performance and also what it means.</p>
    <p>So I have these arrangements on the wall that is a reflection also of the piece, but it's a new piece because it was never shown that way. So it's really incredible.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: I guess we should really begin our conversation with Cuquita the Cuban Doll, your alter ego who appears in most of your performances.</p>
    <p>And for listeners who have never seen Cuquita, I'll briefly describe her. Cuquita’s face is rarely the same. Her eyes and lips are created from magazine cutouts that have been resized and manipulated. She appears almost cartoonish, and the bold color of her hair typically matches the color of her skin, hands, and socks or shoes. She often wears bright patterned clothing. It's safe to say that Cuquita always stands out.</p>
    <p>When I think of the idea of a doll, they are often these passive things to be played with, but your Cuquita seems to always be playing with the audience or whoever's watching her at the time. And you've said in the past that Cuquita has allowed you to make yourself visible in the United States.</p>
    <p>And yet I recognize that stepping into the role of Cuquita requires you to layer and conceal yourself and your body. Would you be comfortable speaking to the ways in that Cuquita has allowed you to liberate yourself and render yourself visible?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Yes,  I guess I should say that Cuquita the Cuban Doll was born in 2018.</p>
    <p>I immigrated from Cuba to the United States in 2011. There is a seven period of time in where I was, let's say, adjusting myself to the new society that I was part of. And I was looking for representation. Where do I fit into this system? I didn't feel represented… My issues, the things that I was going through, it was relevant to the art that I was looking [for] around me.</p>
    <p>And I was doing art at the time. I went to study at the School of the Art Institute and I was having all these thoughts and suddenly people already had preconceived notions about who I was just because I was a Latina, because I was Cuban,  and sometimes I didn't fit in the label or the box that the United States mainstream sometimes has about us Latinas.</p>
    <p>And also I was in this complicated space in between cultures where you're no longer from Cuba, but you're not also from here as well. So all these thoughts came to me and I was trying to address all these and suddenly I wasn't…I felt that I wasn't being heard. And thinking about how can I just create a different image of myself in where, when you see it, you don't have any preconceived notions of who I am. And then you can actually see me or hear me. And then Cuquita was born, right?</p>
    <p>Cuquita is based on cuquitas, which is a paper doll that I used to play with when I was a girl in Havana. It's fair to say that I was… I grew up in the 90s. [That was] a very specific moment in the culture of Cuba. It was called the Special Period. It was a great economic depression after the collapse of the Soviet Union who was the main sponsor of Cuba for many, many decades. So the crisis was really deep and we didn't have anything. We didn't have electricity. We didn't have clothing, food. There was a scarcity in everything. So my doll was a paper doll and it was Cuquita. In the many, many hours that we didn't have electricity, the only thing that I have is my body, my imagination, and a paper doll.</p>
    <p>So this connected to me somehow. It came like a vision, you'd say, and I started to cut what I was doing with Cuquita. You, you put, you cut the paper, you cut the clothing, and you start changing and dressing her. And I just started doing that from the magazines. I cut eyes, I cut lips, and suddenly I put it on my face, and I start playing around with this idea.</p>
    <p>And I liked it. Cuquita, the first performance that I did [as her] was in February 2018, and it was with a piece “Monument to the Great Living Artist,” which was for me, a performance that really changed my history here… my history, my story here in the United States and for sure in the art world.</p>
    <p>From that moment on, I felt a connection. I feel like the audience felt very connected with her story. I started to have these interactions with the audience, who was incredible, because what [Cuquita] was telling many people related to not just Latinas, not just Cubans, [but] anyone who suffered from displacement in anywhere - anyone who doesn't belong to a place and feels like an outsider, [they] don't necessarily need to be an immigrant. Many people feel that way. So, she had many ways to connect with people in different levels of experiences. And that's been incredible.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: And I think the reason so many people are drawn to your work and to Cuquita as well is that you really embody and are able to convey the experience of what it is like to exist in limbo, to exist in this space of unbelonging.</p>
    <p>I think you've spoken a lot about that too. And what does that feel like? And what does that look like to also almost like find a way to exist outside that or build a space for yourself in your body where you can exist outside of that - exist outside of these other categories or expectations that people are thrusting on you.</p

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Absolutely. It took me a while, you know, because when you come from Cuba to the United States…Think about Cuba this socialist place. Let's call it socialist. It's something else, but let's say that. And then United States is the enemy, right? I was growing up all the time thinking that United States is this and that, [but] then you just wish to be here because in the space that you're living in is so terrible, so oppressive.</p>
    <p>And you say, well, I want to go to the enemy because I want to be free. And then you come here. And you are part of a problem that you do not even understand, right? There is a race issue. There is social issues that I am part of without even me wanting to be part of, right? It took me some time to understand, um, sort of what my role could be [here].</p>
    <p>And, um, what the layers of complexities were among the different social groups that were living in here. It's very complicated. I'm still figuring it out.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Do you feel…what do you feel like when you put on Cuquita’s mask or as you're donning the costume and walking outside as Cuquita? Do you feel a certain power when you are performing as her?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: I feel so free. I think one of the first interviews that I did related to this character, someone asked me the same question. And I said, the difference between Cuquita and I is that Cuquita the Cuban Doll lives and exists in freedom. I don't. So she allows me to feel that freedom for the moment that I am embodying her.</p>
    <p>And it's the most incredible feeling, but not just me, because I also work with other performers who embody Cuquita the Cuban Doll, and the common expression or reflection after the performance is, “I feel so free. This is incredible.”</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Cuquita’s body, her spirit offers this like momentary escape from the restrictions of the current world and society that we're all moving through.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: And also as a woman, because she introduces herself as a woman. She identifies herself as a woman. And I think also, thinking about the burden that women - we have. I think she plays with all of that and she makes her own statement of “This is who I am and I am beautiful. I love myself and this is my scenario. Just look at me and enjoy it.”</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: And I, I think so much of what you achieve through Cuquita as well is subverting standards of beauty, of subverting, these also very Western, standards of what it means to look like or be a woman and the way that you shapeshift, and play with her face and with her costumes. And these are some of your self portraits that you did as Cuquita, the “Untitled Nine Cuquitas” and also “Untitled Mami Yankee,” and there's this like brazen boldness to it as well and this playfulness and humor that comes through your work.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: I never thought of humor with my work. Cause I'm very serious. I'm a Capricorn. So Capricorns, we are very serious. Um, but, everyone was saying…Oh, you're…it started with the clothing. “Your clothing is so…it has so much humor.”</p>
    <p>And I said, “This is not funny. I don't think it's funny at all.” But then I started to understand that it was  a playfulness with the idea of the absurd. What is the real? What is reality? And I was totally playing with those concepts, right? And it took me a while to understand that there was a lot of humor.</p>
    <p>And now I embrace it and I enjoy it. I always like to be very provocative. I would say that the humor is very connected to provocation. And through humor, also, I make people reflect on things by not being very harsh. Because my subjects can be very down. If you look at it in a way, it deals with trauma, with pain, with politics and how heavy on the individual [they] can be. And those subjects are really hard to take in, but you have to find ways in where the context is in a way fun and playful.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Could you also speak a little bit to your background in fashion and when you decided to not necessarily diverge, but focus more specifically on performance and visual art?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Totally. I started doing costumes [when] I was 15 years old. I found, through my image, I could protest without having to speak. And that rebel spirit helped me to think about ways in where I can communicate with others without having to have a sign on the street and making a protest. Because you have to be very smart with the Cuban government because they take you to jail, they follow you, and they can make your life very, very difficult.</p>
    <p>So that relationship with clothing, it was very strong and very intimate from a very early age. When I moved to United States, I studied fashion in the School of the Art Institute. I always have loved loved clothing. I feel protected. I feel empowered. I feel like I can express my individuality, especially coming from a place in where everyone should look the same and follow rules.</p>
    <p>It was my way to say that I am different and I like it. So then you get into the profession and I work in fashion for about… in New York for two years. And then in Chicago, I studied. The thing is, like, I got into fashion enough to know that it wasn't my place. I have nothing bad to say about it. I loved it. I think it's amazing. But I felt like it's just about the surface. And when I said it's about the surface, I mean it's just the body. It doesn't extend from that, even if you have the most incredible ideas. It just stays here. And I felt like I needed to express more and work with more mediums - that it was just not clothing and a mannequin or a model.</p>
    <p>And performance, it's been always in my life. And I said, okay, this is the time in making a decision, a choice. And I was walking in the Guggenheim, because this, this was real…this was a revelation I had. In 2000, I think it was 2016 or 2017, it was the show of this artist, uh, what's her name? Hmm. Agnes Martin. I went to it [for] my birthday.</p>
    <p>And I thought a gift for me is going to the Guggenheim [to] see the show because I absolutely adore her work. And I was walking around and suddenly I enter in a room and it was a video of her working in the studio when she moved to New Mexico and she was talking…someone was talking to her and she was like painting and moving around. Nothing exceptional happened in the video. But I just saw her and I was like, “Okay, I want to be this. I want to be an artist.” And that was it.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Also, because you brought up the Guggenheim, I was reminded of your series of public protests and performances, “No Me Pongan en lo Oscuro” (Do Not Bury Me in Darkness), and I'll just give listeners a little bit of an intro to this work.</p>
    <p>So this work is an ongoing series of unannounced, performative actions that have occurred outside famous art institutions where you and fellow collaborators call attention to the invisibility and erasure of Latinx artists from the art world. And you've performed this work at Art Basel, Miami, MoMA PS1, the Met, the Guggenheim, MoMA, and the Whitney.</p>
    <p>And in these performances, you appear as Cuquita alongside collaborators who you have dressed in similar masks and clothing. And I love the outfits, the shirts and leggings that have the multicolored outline of a middle finger that you can't necessarily see from far away, but as you get closer, it's more apparent.</p>
    <p>And the costumes also include this large phallic piece that sort of spills out from between the performer's legs. And in all of the images that I've seen of the different actions, the performers stand in this straight line and sort of look silently and stare out at anyone who may walk by.</p>
    <p>The first performance from the series occurred in Fall 2020. What motivated you to devise this work and create these actions, particularly during that moment in the pandemic?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Yes, the pandemic was a moment of shift for me in a way…well for everyone, I guess. There was a discussion that performance was over, that we won't be able to perform again. And many people, well, most people were in our apartments. We couldn't go out. And I felt like, “Why wouldn't [I] go and make a performance on the street?” And I've been thinking of this idea for quite some time.</p>
    <p>I felt like Latinx women, we were not represented in all our diversity within the mainstream. You ask yourself, “Why is it that not many Latinx women are in the history of art?” When you know from what we are doing now, there are so many fellow artists that are working and they're so amazing. And my question is, are we going to be in 20, 30 years, part of the history? Some other girl like me who was looking for someone who speaks [on what] she was going through, is she going to find it? Because I couldn't find it! But they are here and they have been here forever. But we don't know it. So that thought, it was flying around my head and I said we have to do something related to this and call attention to this problem. And it came to me that the best way was doing these actions in front of the museums or institutional spaces that hold a lot of responsibility for what history is and how it's written.</p>
    <p>So in 2020, along with the Immigrant Artist Biennial, they invited me…I was part of the biennial in the exhibition show, in the gallery, let's say. But Katya Grokhovsky, which is someone that I absolutely adore, she said, “Let's do a performance and what do you want to do?” And I said, “Well, I want to do this, because I've been thinking about it, and I think it's time to do it.” And she said, “I love it. Let's do it.” And we went to the Whitney and everything just started from there.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: How did people react to your presence and the presence of your collaborators in those spaces?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: It was phenomenal. If you want to feel good about your work, go to the street. It was great. People were very curious. They wanted to know. At the beginning, I didn't put any message. I wanted just the presence. That was my initial thought. But there were so many questions, you know, they were asking me, and we are, we're not talking to the audience. We are standing still, not moving, very stoic, very related to the women who were fighting for voting at the beginning of 20th century, following that route of “We can't talk, but we are here and we're present. You don't want to listen to me, but I'm here and you're looking at me…” But since the response of the audience was so incredible and they gather[ed] around us and they wanted to know more, they were asking the photographer or the video person because I am actually always performing, so I couldn't talk to them.</p>
    <p>So then by the action number five at MoMA PS1, we decided to put a text, a reflection of why we were there. And that followed Art Basel, which we also had some signs and we're walking around and all that.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Yes, and I love the signs that you created. I think this was an excerpt from the one that was at Art Basel. “Dear Art Gallery owners, we encourage you to represent and show more Latinx female artists.” Or “How many Latinx women artists have had one person exhibitions at MoMA PS1?”</p>
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Zero to this day!</p>
    <p>Asia Stewart: That was in 2021 when MoMA PS1 was showing the…</p>
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Greater New York exhibition. Yes. Which is shocking! I mean, this year they got a little better trying to include diversity. But that exhibition is so problematic. I don't know if you have seen it. When I just moved to New York in 2011, it was up. That was the first time, I think, around that time. I don't want to mistake [the] year. When I walk[ed] around it, I said, “This can't be real. We're in New York. Where are the Latinx women or anyone?” It was a white show.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah. And I think again, what you accomplished so brilliantly was bringing to light those hypocrisies and those contradictions, in a way where people could engage, they could step up and read the sign. They could learn more and it's something that I'm sure has stuck with so many people who encountered your work and encountered that public action.</p>
    <p>Yali Romagoza: There were incredible communications after…conversations. People were really listening and reading and talking among them and asking themselves the same questions.</p>
    <p>Asia Stewart: You know, during the action, you and the other performers would stand straight. You were stoic, you were silent. And that's something that I've seen in some of your other works as well, where your body almost transforms from being not just a performer, but moving into the world of being a sculpture as well…a physical sculpture.</p>
    <p>This is something that I saw in “Meditating My Way Out of Capitalism and Communism, 12,410 Days of Isolation,” which you performed in Art in Odd Places, I think back in 2018. And then also in “90 Miles,” which you performed twice in both Kentucky, I believe, and then here in New York at Chashama.</p>
    <p>In the first performance in “Meditating,” you sat on the ground near subway stations along 14th Street, and there was a sign posted near you that said, “Hello, my name is Cuquita the Cuban Doll. I was born in Havana and now I live in New York. I identify as a woman. I find myself surrounded by thorns. Also, I bleed every month. I will meditate my way out of capitalism and communism for 30 minutes. Join me if you want. Please don't touch me.”</p>
    <p>I guess my first question for this piece, and I've seen all the photos of you from this work, and also the short video documentation, and you are sat perfectly poised and still in your meditation pose. What was the experience of going through that day, and did people stop to join you? Did people try to speak with you? And how did people engage with your body in that very, very public space?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Very scary. It was very scary, in a way, because they wasn't sure I was human, so they wanted to come very close to me to see if I was breathing.</p>
    <p>And that terrifies me, because I had my eyes covered. Usually Cuquita has eyes, I make little holes so I can see, but in this meditation I took it by heart, and I was, I was not looking, my eyes were closed. So it was my trust in the city, in the city of New York.</p>
    <p>Now that I am talking this out loud, it came to me, this thought for the first time. It was my love for New York and the trust I have. The interaction with the audience was scary, but beautiful. They were reading, they were talking, they were asking me, or “this being” [since] they were not sure who it was [or] what was happening. They were enjoying everything that they were looking at.</p>
    <p>I have a memorable moment, where two men…were talking to each other and they were reading the sign and one says to the other, “But she bleeds every month. Why?” And the other said, “Because of her period.” And the other said, “Are you sure?” And he said, “Yes!”, but the other said, “I think she is hurt.”</p>
    <p>That was…I could just get up and leave. It was enough. It was incredible. Wow.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: And in your work in 90 miles, I've seen some documentation from the performance you did at Chashama. This is a work where you're sitting atop an open suitcase that's filled with keepsakes and notes.</p>
    <p>And you also have these blown up globe balloons as well, and you're frozen, seated as Cuquita, and there's this one photo where there's a man who has come so close to your face, [yet he’s] not quite touching you. Do you find that when you're in gallery spaces and performing that people forget that you are a person performing and treat you as an object?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: They do. With this performance, it happened [for] the first time. I had no idea. I wasn't really thinking at all. Having a conversation about being, living a sculpture, right? Of being a human sculpture? I just didn't move because I was…I thought it was the best way to spend the 57 minutes. It was related to the time that took my flight from Havana to Miami.</p>
    <p>So I was sitting in the suitcase with all the belongings that I brought from Havana to United States when I knew I wasn't coming back, which everything has emotional values related. It was no functional object whatsoever. I not even, I don't think I not even brought underwear. It was, it was crazy.</p>
    <p>So when you're in the plane, you're basically sitting, right? So that was my initial thought. I've been sitting here for 57 minutes and that's it. So I was doing that and suddenly start people coming, walking around. And I hear someone saying, “Where is the artist? I want to meet her.” And the gallery owner goes, “She's performing, she's right there.” And she said, “What? Is that a real person?” And she said, “Yes!” And then, they come closer to see me breathing. And I realized it was really interesting. The idea of being a doll, like really a doll. Right. And also this idea of making your body feel pain because when you're not moving, all your body changes in a way that everything starts to feel very painful.</p>
    <p>I don't know if you have experienced this before, but after I do a performance for so long where I'm not moving, it takes me a while to come back to who I am. So I said, this is interesting. The idea of not moving, it adds another layer of meaning to the character and also to my work and everything I'm doing.</p>
    <p>So with that experience, I…when I did the performance the second time, it was no surprise to me that many people thought the same thing. Also, I'm not moving, but I'm breathing. You know, sometimes I move a little because I am a human. And it's shocking to me how even [if] I do that for a few seconds maybe, they still believe I am not a person.</p>
    <p>And also the liberty they feel in touching me, in wanting to handle me. In the way that you handle a doll, right?</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah, the assumption of ownership over the objects that they encounter in the space and viewing you as something that they can manipulate at will. This brings me to one of your more recent performances, “Pain of Cuba, Body I Am”, which I've watched several times.</p>
    <p>Yali Romagoza: You're not the only one. I love that performance.</p>
    <p>Asia Stewart: It's really stunning. In this performance, you enter into a dialogue with Ana Mendieta, after you dreamt of Ana three times. And so you begin this work by lying on a bed of sand, and projected behind you is Mendieta's uh, silueta sangrienta, which translates to bloody silhouette.</p>
    <p>So, in the audience, we repeatedly see Mendieta attempting to insert her body into a landscape. And of course, the performance is also titled after one of Mendieta's poems of the same name, and we hear your voice reciting Mendieta's words at the beginning:</p>
    <p>“In Cuba when you die / the earth that covers us / speaks / But here / covered by the earth whose prisoner I am / I feel death palpitating underneath / the earth…my whole body is filled with want of Cuba / I go on to make my work upon the earth / to go on is victory”</p>
    <p>I just wanted to ask first, because I think it really centers and grounds the work, What does this poem mean to you? What do Ana Mendieta’s words mean to you?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: It's a lot. Ana is probably the only artist that I know who…we were talking about representation, right? When I was dealing with so many things and I was trying to find an answer, because I always knew about Ana, right? Ana is a big figure in the arts and it's a Cuban pride, so we're all very proud. And when I was living in Cuba and studying art history… we didn't really exactly study her work, but we knew about her.</p>
    <p>And for me, at that time, she was this, icon, feminist icon, right? Who did body work, and she was very famous and she died, very young and very tragically. That was it. I never thought more about that. But then after I was living in here, and Carmelita Tropicana and Ela Troyano were dear friends and one of my idols, they were having some action related to the exhibition “Radical Women” in Brooklyn Museum.</p>
    <p>And they want me to reflect on Ana's work. So then I was, you know, getting ready to do that, and I was looking at her work again, and suddenly everything changed. I started to see her work for the first time, and understand the pain, the trauma, the displacement, the not belonging. This absolute need for healing, and it stuck to me very, very strong. And then I started to feel this peace, like I had someone to talk to.</p>
    <p>And, I didn't know much about…well, I reflected on, on thatin the exhibition, and I found this incredible phrase that she said, that American feminism is a white middle class movement. That she said at the end of the 70s, which is so bold.</p>
    <p>She was in the midst of it, right? She was exhibiting in her gallery, and having that statement is like, wow. And I felt the same way, right? So many years happened after, and I still don't feel the voices of Latinx women, all their voices in this feminism movement in a way. So I share all of that in the exhibition and it was beautiful.</p>
    <p>But then, I started to have [mutual] friends with her, which is very surprising to me because I never met her, obviously when she died, I was not even born or I was just born, I think I [was] one year old, something, and I'm not family to her, but then I started to investigate about her life and she was very spiritual.</p>
    <p>I went to a conversation with her niece, a presentation of her work that she was doing about Ana's work, and she mentioned to the audience that she also had these connections with her through dreams. So it didn't feel so foreign. I feel like the connection is very organic because we have had the same experience almost.</p>
    <p>So I started to have dreams with her and I didn't know exactly what that meant. That led me to research about her life. And I found this beautiful poem, and I think it's a beautiful metaphor, not just to the Cuban diaspora, but everyone who is feeling this need to connect to the land that they were from, because not even Cuba, the country or the people or the government is the land. What you actually means is the land. It's just the streets and the trees and the color. It is very strange to explain, but [this longing is] very connected to the land.</p>
    <p>So that made me have this conversation with her work. The Colby Museum and the University of Colby, they approached me and they wanted…that I present a performance there.</p>
    <p>And I went to the archives and I found this work of hers. And I said, I would love to have a conversation with her work. “Is this possible?” And they said sure.</p>

    <p>Asia Stewart: There's one point in the performance you say… I'm paraphrasing, but you essentially say, “It took me coming here and experiencing the pain of being here [in the U.S.] and of being here as someone who is marginalized, who is other, who is woman, who is Latinx, to understand you and to see you.” You being Ana.</p>
    <p>Did you find, you know, the act of performing this piece to be restorative in some way?</p>

    <p>Yali Romagoza: I almost collapsed at the end. I was warned of this to happen by spiritualists and people who work with energies. They told me to be very cautious, and I didn't listen that well. I went ahead and I do it anyways and...by the end of the performance, I felt this energy through my body that I couldn't control. I got a bit scared because no one in the audience was going to be able to help me. And then I just tried to slow down a bit and I sort of exit abruptly at the end. Because I was going to fall down. It took me some time to recover. It was intense.</p>

    <p>Asia Stewart: And I think also the piece, I can only assume, brings up so much because you are recounting these dreams that you've had. The first dream, you mention that, so you ask Ana, “What do I have to do?” And she hugs you, and it's very, you know, feels very tender. And the second dream, you come across a naked woman lying on the street covered by white flowers, and Ana's guarding the naked woman. And then in the third dream, Ana's alive, and you're in a car on your way to see her.</p>
    <p>To hear yourself, right, because you were the narrator of the piece, recounting these stories, and then to complete the actions of the performance, which you sort of beautifully spread across these red flower petals into the shape or into the silhouette of a person and then you proceed to dance with such energy and force that I can assume like wear and take so much from, you know, out of yourself.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Absolutely. Also the song that I put at the end, it's a song for Yemaya, which is the goddess of the sea. She's the one who let you cross the sea safely. But she's also the one who has seen many Cubans die crossing the sea. And that dance is also a connection to Ana, but it's also... honoring all the ones who have died coming here to find a dream.</p>

    <p>Asia Stewart: Sitting with that loss and recognizing their spirits as well and bringing that into the space and into the audience...</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: It's a lot of energy for a tiny body. I'm very small.</p>
    <p>Asia Stewart: I know we're coming up to the end of our conversation, Yali, but thank you so much for sharing so much of your energy and spirit, with me and, and with us for whoever's listening.</p>
    <p>What are some things that you're looking forward to working on the rest of the summer at your studio or any directions that you want to point the audience towards to follow you?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Yes. Thank you. First, I want to thank you. It's been a lovely conversation. You're a good listener. I like that. I am working right now in a performance that I'm going to do on August 3rd.</p>
    <p>Yes. It's part of a residency called Siren Art in Asbury Park Beach in New Jersey. So I am working on the costume. I guess I forgot to say something important. The costume is always the foundation of my work, so everything comes in addition with the costume. The costume comes first and then everything connects.</p>
    <p>So I'm working in the studio on the costume, and then I am going to have an Open Studio in October, my first open studio in EFA. And I invite you and everyone to go.</p>
    <p>Asia Stewart: I will definitely, definitely be there. And for listeners, you can also find Yali at her website www.yaliromagoza.org</p>
    <p>Or you can also find her on Instagram as @cuquitathecubandoll</p>
    <p>Thank you so, so, so much and I'm just looking forward to everything that's to come and I'm feeling so grateful and so fed by our discussion, Yali.</p>
    <p>Yali Romagoza: Thank you.</p>
