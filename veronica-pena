<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu. I'll also be your host. In every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn a little bit more about their practice and motivations.</p>
  <p>And in this episode, I am so, so, so delighted to be speaking with Verónica Peña. Verónica Peña is an interdisciplinary artist and independent curator from Spain based in the United States. Her performances explore the impact that absence, separation, and loss have on the human condition. Resisting limiting forces, from the enforcement of restrictive immigration policies, to the operation of machismo, Verónica aspires to foster unity and connection in a world that sows division.</p>
  <p>For Verónica, the materiality of the items she uses in performances is key. She often fully envelops her body in these items and props, participating in a physical metamorphosis that momentarily alters the appearance of her body.</p>
  <p>Welcome to the Open Studios podcast, Verónica. How are you doing today?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Hello, Asia. I'm fine. Thank you for the invitation and thank you to PerformVu for, you know, including me in the adventure.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Absolutely. It's such a privilege to be speaking with you. To begin, I just want to start off by focusing on your performance, The Body in the Substance. I had the pleasure of watching this performance live in person back in 2021 at the NARS Foundation.</p>
  <p>In this performance, you submerge yourself in a large tank that is filled with a liquid that coagulates. You breathe through a tube that allows you to stay underwater for hours at a time, and lights beam out around you, and an assistant intermittently adds colorful liquids into the tank that stretch around your body until the tank grows murky.</p>
  <p>You've said that this piece can find you in the most beautiful stillness, placing you in a position where you are unable to talk or see. So I'm curious; my question is, how did a performance that required your body's confinement become liberatory for you?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Liberatory is a big word for me. Um, I think, you know, it can be interpreted many, many ways from my own perspective.</p>
  <p>If I go to what I feel the most, I think it's liberatory because it opens a door to possibility. All my performances start with an intuitive gesture that then I expand into a more complex project. When I started performing– I started when I moved to the U.S. I am an immigrant to this country. I've been here since 2006.</p>
  <p>I, you know, when I moved here, I started that gesture, the gesture of covering the skin with the paint. I used to be a painter, but I stopped painting. Instead of painting, I started to cover the skin. That gesture became even more present when I lost my father while I was living here.</p>
  <p>So, I'm gonna open this circle between what it was and is not anymore, between the past and the present, life and death, the here and the there. So it opens a world of possibility for me. In my initial works with stillness and confinement, the materials were both on the body. In a way, it was a little strange, but they were a substance.</p>
  <p>It becomes a caress. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right? A caress. It's not pain. It's a neutral area where you can really stay there and, you know, everything that's more important disappears, and you're really focused on your body, and the experience. It has many readings, but I think for me it's to build a space of hope: hope for may…for what may happen when you challenge the body in that way.</p>
  <p>And it does things I would say are liberatory.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah, well, I think the experience that I had as a viewer watching this performance, you almost create a portal through the tank. And you rupture time because what I'm hearing and the language that you're using it, you're creating this third space, this other space that doesn't exist in the here and now. And it doesn't necessarily exist in the past, but it's in this other world that you're building or shaping– at least that you're able to temporarily occupy when you're underwater, when you were submerged and held and caressed, as you said, hugged by the substance that surrounded you.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: It’s hard to describe how it is to be inside, you know. Because when, for instance, when I submerge in water, the struggle of the movement or the reaction of the body is different because you are still suspended in something that is not solid. It’s like a middle territory, you know, it's a very strange feeling.</p>
  <p>I don't really know how to explain it. But it's one of the more peaceful moments I have experienced in my life.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: How did you go about selecting or testing the liquid that you used in the tank?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Well, you know when I wrote this proposal on The Body in The Substance, I was working on another project where I was only submerging the head.</p>
  <p>I got really obsessed with the idea of coagulation, you know, with the material coagulating by itself. But it’s not just the material, it's the material and the body. And the body has so many limitations in terms of temperature, the chemistry that goes around. So I tried so many materials, and at the beginning my idea was– I was really stubborn, you know, when I say I'm going to do something, no matter what I'm going to do it– and I tried things that were connected to biology, chemistry, molecular gastronomy.</p>
  <p>And the process is like that. It was trial and error, you know, and then you use one amount…The proportions, everything changes when you go bigger. So even I say, oh, this is working so well, then I will go bigger, and it will be a mess. And I started to get more in touch with the water itself.</p>
  <p>Also, you know, the first time I showed this project to the public was through an online performance via Zoom. So what you see on the screen is not, you know– and sometimes I pick the materials based on what I was looking at. And when it became live, I changed some of them just because I am driven by visuals.</p>
  <p>For instance, in the performance that you saw– which was the first time for me to enact this, so it was like a pilot– in general, my work is about counteracting violence. So when I am inside the tank, there were moments that feel more violent. You know, the performance starts clean, just with water and the naked body, and then it becomes reddish. Then there is this more plastic-y scene.</p>
  <p>At the beginning, I didn't do it because of the plastic issues. I really felt the sensation of hitting the water. And I liked it because it was soft but at the same time toxic. And it goes around you, sometimes it will go around the tube, sometimes it gets on the face. And even if it makes things harder, I put this type of powder [in the water] that reminds me of the dirtiness of everything that we have to confront and swallow. And we have to see how to deal with it.</p>
  <p>And then I also had the idea of dust, and how the gray dust covers everything.  It’s associated with the notion of death or disappearance. So, the end of the performance [had] more this type, all that type of texture.</p>
  <p>I also do the sound. I work with an artist, and I tell them, you know, I hear this, but I don't know how to do it. Her name is Tara Gladden. She's excellent, and she's just a very good musician. So, everything is kind of like poetry. I'm talking too much.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: No, you're not talking too much at all! I just wanted to agree with you on many points. I think that, for one, the sound is, from what I remember from the performance that I saw, there was this operatic quality to the music that was playing and it almost magnifies the epic nature of what you're doing and of the journey that your body is undergoing. And of the transformation that we even see occur within the tank too, from this clear water that becomes murky and almost muddy over time.</p>
  <p>The inclusion of the plastic in that performance was so key because for me it really communicated that sense of violence. Because the plastic is that inorganic material, something that we often see or identify as being waste. And for me, seeing your body wrapped in the plastic, brought up images of marine mammals that have been suffocated by plastic, or of just detritus that's been discarded outside on the sidewalk.</p>
  <p>And then to see that paired with the red liquid that surrounded you definitely communicated the sense of violence or danger.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest-info">Verónica Peña, podcast guest.</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: I try to work in an open way, I don't try to direct everything in terms of– I mean, it's not possible, right? And I love when the viewer or the audience… I love the people having the experience to say things [about the work].</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I like to think of it sometimes as the viewers’ perspective of the performance often illustrates or speaks more to perhaps their world view or their emotional state or whatever it is from the performance that they specifically connect with— what speaks to them.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Yeah, which I think is fantastic.</p>
  <p>And for me, all these sensations [and] feedback that I receive, expands the project. It makes it grow. And maybe if I go in next time, I will take that feedback. And I forget other aspects even if sometimes they are the most important part. But the breathing was– especially because it coincided with the pandemic– it was something that moved a lot of people, even if the work was presented online.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: We often assume or take for granted that breathing is involuntary and we forget that we breathe, you know, second to second, moment to moment throughout the day. And to have that sound amplified and magnified in the space made me think of the vulnerability of our bodies and the fragility of each breath. To hear that and to see that struggle, I think, for, for air and for life.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Yeah, we take it for granted sometimes. And underwater, even if the tank that I use is not that deep, you can see the weight of the water in the glass, so I really had to learn how to breathe if I wanted to stay longer inside this space. The first hour or so, it feels like I'm not going to make it [laughs].</p>
  <p>I keep floating, everything is moving, but to float in the tube for so long, you know, it creates tension in your muscles. There are many things that happen, right? But then the next hour felt like five minutes. So I think it's really a place to learn something or to discover something different.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I was just going to ask, what was the longest period of time that you allowed yourself to be submerged?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: The longest I have done is seven hours. And you know, I don’t do anything to the water to keep it warm. So it starts warm, but it's just a natural process of getting colder. And you are not moving. So, there's a point where I feel: that's it. I get lethargic. That's the point for me to abandon [the water] but I have submerged for so many minutes.</p>
  <p>And now, because I moved back to New York, I don't have my water tank and I feel like I lost something [laughs]. There’s something in there that I see that can grow.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: This may be a silly comparison for me to make, but I know that many people enjoy and have sought out access to sensory deprivation tanks. Where you're not fully submerged in the way that you were in the tank, but people can float in water that's filled with high quantities of salt, and you're able to float in total darkness for perhaps 30 minutes or an hour or so. People say that they feel some sense of peace, as you've said, or they're able to escape the busyness of their minds.</p>
  <p>And that also makes me think of the fact that you've given others the opportunity, members of the public, the opportunity, to submerge themselves in the tank. So I wanted to ask what types of feedback or what have people shared with you about their experiences being submerged in the tank?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: I have never tried one of the– what do you call it? Sensory deprivation tanks? I haven't tried one of those, but one of the participants did. She told me it was nothing like this because when you are floating, you can relax. But in the tank, you are trying to find the connection with the water, the balance between your body and the water, and the water will move you up.</p>
  <p>So it's really an exercise to understand your body in that medium, to not float, or to stop moving inside. You know, when I perform, people tell me “you make it look so easy.” [laughs] But it's like, now I understand the water. I can go inside and I quickly adjust my body, my inner mind/self, to what is surrounding me.</p>
  <p>It's good that you brought it up because that's something I had forgotten. So with the participants–  I invite them to submerge in water, 'cause you have to get inside a water tank, which is– that's an important part. How do you get inside? You know, the [tanks are] not made for that. I got people into where to put their hands and where not. Because it's fragile. And I use a glass tank, so you really have to know where not to put your weight.</p>
  <p>One of the participants, he told me…you know, it's interesting how we judge people because I thought he was a strong person. He was like, let's do this. We talked a little bit before. I give them a particular thing to do, you know, to think ahead of getting in the water. And he went inside. When he jumped in, he was scared of the, you know, that he could not get the next piece of air into his lungs. And so he cannot relax. So I had to tell him: I’m here. I explained what to do.</p>
  <p>Another person that submerged, she told me something that really stuck with me, because she told me– I’m not going to use the exact words, because I cannot remember exactly–  but she said, I don't feel beautiful most of the time, but I feel beautiful in here. Being in this protected space, it's a different experience.</p>
  <p>One of the people that came was afraid of water. So how do we do this in a way that she can enjoy the experience? And she stayed inside for half an hour, and that was it. I try to bring something good to the person, if I can. Of course, it's not going to happen all the time.</p>
  <p>Some people are so keen because they wanted to have a picture underwater. So, you know, it's a learning experience for me, too, because for me it's important to have some kind of respect for the work. One time with one of the participants, I felt–not used, but, you know, this person was more here for the picture than anything else.</p>
  <p>I don't know. So it's very weird. Everything's kind of weird. But I think that these interactions with people are very important, all of them, because it really is a thermometer of how we are doing. It’s my way of interacting with people, of creating these alternate realities that are not the everyday aspect of life.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I think creating a space or zone that is so therapeutic or can offer comfort to people, can offer this very new, unfamiliar experience or sensation to people. When you referenced [that] participant who submerged too, it sounded like they approached it more as entertainment or as if it was an attraction to be documented and later shared on social media.</p>
  <p>That's not what your work is about. I think particularly in The Body in the Substance when you're performing, you are connecting with your surrounding environment. And when you offer that performance to others, or when you offer people the chance to submerge themselves in the tank, it's something that is very serious. It is very, uh, personal and intimate.</p>
  <p>I'm so grateful that I had the opportunity to see that in person.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Yeah, I saw that you were there. I knew you because of your work and different environments, but I didn't know you were there until you told me.</p>
  <p>I am so very thankful to the many foundations that have supported this project, because it's not easy to bring so much water into a space. And I realized that they really need to trust me. I tend to be humble, so in those moments, I had to really say, “I know what I am doing. You have to trust me.”</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And it's a work that you've developed over three, four, five years now.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Yeah, yeah. My first version of this, only with the head, was in 2015–</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: So it has been a long time.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Yeah. And I have a lot of work, like, it's one of the layers where…it really touches me that I have [it]. I keep working on it, you know, it's, it's hard, it's hard for me to do that, I don't know how it is for you, but I tend to jump from one thing to another because I get bored.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I'm the same.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: So this one is keeping me interested because I don't know what is going to come. And other ones I can predict. I can tell, oh, if I do this, this and that, this is going to happen. But this one is more unpredictable for me and I think I like it.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: So I want to also focus on another one of your performances that investigates how imposed limitations or restrictions can potentially be generative.</p>
  <p>So this is the “Carried Body” series. You develop the series: “Carried Bodies,” “La Maquina Dormida,” at a time when your body was recovering from an injury. And in this performance, you tightly wrap black thread around your face and body to the point where your eyes are essentially sewn shut. You then cover yourself in multiple liquids and a darker, almost brown liquid allows you to break the threads that bound your body and you're able to escape.</p>
  <p>How did this performance change the relationship that you have with your body and your understanding of the healing process?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: I don't think the performance changed the relationship to my body. I think it was the experience that generated the performance. I have an injury in one of my wrists so I was going to physical therapy for a while. It was an injury to the inner ligaments of the wrist.</p>
  <p>There is really not much that you can do except to follow the rhythm and the process of the body to heal from that. During the conversations with the therapist, I learned that it's when you sleep that your body really repairs. It may be very obvious for some people, but for me it was interesting. I was also taking an anatomy class, so I was really conscious about how the body works inside.</p>
  <p>During this injury, I couldn't work. for a while. So I started to think about the body, the threads that connect. In that performance, there is a point where my face gets connected to my leg and to my foot. So if I move my leg, then it oppresses my face. Or sometimes when you lose a member of your body, the body compensates.</p>
  <p>These threads were forcing me to see what happens in my body when my head is connected to my foot or when I cannot do a certain movement.</p>
  <p>In my work, I talk a lot about the invisible or the hidden limitations and talking more about society and the impositions that we sometimes are not able to put a name to. When you suffer racism, or situations of machismo, those for me are really evident, but sometimes they are, like, encapsulated in what is happening, like, you don't feel good, but you don't realize what it is.</p>
  <p>There is a moment in the performance, this is the first time that I take the substance out of the tank, which for me was another thing: should I do it, should I not do it, what am I doing? And I put the, I pour this liquid into the wounds. You know, I do feel pain because sometimes my teeth are connected to my knee, so if my knee cannot hold up, it will pull down my mouth. So, you know, there is a level of pain that for me is part of life. I didn't want it to be too– I don't like to promote pain, but it's part of what it is.</p>
  <p>And this liquid is very calming, so the heat, the pain, it calms it down. I think my work is very simple. [laughs]</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: No I don't, I don't think it's simple at all. I think it's incredibly complex. And also you really do physicalize the human experience, and you distill and focus and capture these really often universal challenges that someone may face.</p>
  <p>There are so many times when our bodies disobey us or we often I think try to separate the physical, our body from our mind and really the two are very much connected. I think what that performance really touches on is– I would imagine it made you so much more conscious of, of your body and how each small section and part of your body was connected to the other and how that influences or controls movement or defines movement.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Yeah– also being naked, you know. I am only naked when I feel the work needs that nakedness. But for me, it still is an element of pressure, you know, because I am too cautious, too conscious of my nakedness. I don't know, it's another element that I never talk about, but– being naked in front of somebody while modifying your body.</p>
  <p>I've seen some expressions in the faces of people like, you know, the face of disapproval. And I'm very interested in that face because I think disapproval is what I am interested in challenging.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Absolutely. I think because a lot of my performances also have included nudity and I think it's something that's very natural, and in my work I'm often trying to acquaint or reacquaint myself with my body, and there's perhaps a similar healing process that I try to undergo in my work. But I think it's interesting when people are so uncomfortable by viewing the naked body, the nude body, when people are angry to see that in public spaces or in gallery spaces.</p>
  <p>I'm also really interested in that discomfort or that hesitation. It's interesting to make people sit with that discomfort and to challenge their assumptions of what is acceptable and what's not.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Yes, you know I just moved back to New York after seven years living in Indiana. And I am very excited because I applied for a fine arts program here near Bushwick in Ridgewood. And I got accepted. This initiative will give you a studio for two months without having to pay anything for it. I found the open call interesting because they were interested in something that is outside of your comfort zone. How do I reconcile the making of performances with the fabrication of objects?</p>
  <p>And I worked on objects for a while, other than the artifacts that my performances naturally create. So, in this residency, I'm doing a project that's called “Blurring the Self,” where I invite people to submerge their head inside a little tank, and we talk about the dissolution of barriers, how to step out of individuality, and the participants, they move their head and they dissolve these boundaries.</p>
  <p>So I'm working on: how do I translate these moments that happen under the water into objects? And what I'm doing is I'm trying to create these large scale paintings without modifying too much what I get from the videos.</p>
  <p>And you– you want to participate? [laughs]</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I'd love to. Absolutely.</p>
</div>

<div class="host-info">Asia Stewart, podcast host.</div>
<div class="guest-info">Verónica Peña, podcast guest.</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Yeah, or if anybody that is listening to this would like to have a chance to be portrayed in that way, I would appreciate it. I would love it.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I think that's a beautiful way to, one, invite so many more people into your practice and into your work because all of the images that you're creating are participatory by nature. And then, secondly, just to find a way to capture this moment that really can't be contained, that moment of submersion, really.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Nothing looks so alive to me as the performances, so every transition I do into an object is like, until I find the right thing, it feels like it's losing life.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I think it's interesting when we think about performance objects, whether it's the remnants of the performance or something that was inspired by the performance, how the object is not trying to emulate or replicate the performance, because that's impossible, but how can it maybe present this altered perspective of the work?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: And sometimes artifacts can be very dark objects. It's not something that I can always present, for instance in my applications. It depends where, in which direction I am pointing, you know?</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: It’s a process of experimentation and it's nice to see sometimes what remains or the residue that's left behind.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Yeah. I think it's good to be out of your comfort zone, you know, because–  I don't want to say it is easy for me to do performance, but I really feel comfortable doing performance. So when making these objects– I'm calling them objects because I don't know what else to call them– it's really a process of fabrication. It's different. It's very different.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Absolutely. I think also a core element of performance is the fact that you are witnessed, that there are typically witnesses to the performance that you're undergoing. And there is some level of interaction with an audience that's present, either in person live or virtually.</p>
  <p>And so it is very, very different to be creating an object in isolation of either a performance or other people.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Yes.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Anything else that you would like to leave us with, Verónica, before we say goodbye?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Well, I just want to say thank you. I think it's very interesting what you are doing with PerformVu. And I hope that it really becomes a place to find success and, you know, a place where we can all share what we do and open more room for the discipline of performance.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: That's what I hope too! That's exactly what I hope for and wish for. And I just want to thank you for sharing so much of yourself and particularly just opening up these windows to the works that you have created and particularly letting us all learn a little bit more about The Body in the Substance, especially. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Verónica Peña: Thank you.</p>
