<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu, and I'll also be your host. In every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn more about their practice and motivations.
</div>

<div class="host">
  And in this episode, I have the pleasure of speaking with Lisette Ros. Lisette investigates daily conventions and quotidian behaviors. She approaches her performances as experiments or opportunities to research and collect data about her body, all in the attempt to better understand her fluid queer identity and consider the question, “who is she in the midst of it all?” She embraces discomfort and vulnerability, particularly in durational works that span multiple hours or even days. Lisette is continually familiarizing herself with her flesh, blood, and breath, turning everyday actions into extraordinary spectacles. I am so, so excited for this conversation. Welcome Lisette.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: Thank you. Wow.
</div>

<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: I think I want to begin our conversation with a question about environment and place. So, I read in a 2023 interview with Metal Magazine, you said or you mentioned how important it is for you to familiarize yourself with the location where you'll be performing. And you said, 
  “I need to get a sense of the energy there, the materials used, the inter-architecture, and find a connection between the location, and most importantly, the concept itself. Therefore, I always need to bond with the place, location, or space in advance, although I never rehearse or choreograph a performance piece. I devise a system of conditions for the work and the live performance. I must adhere to these conditions as an artist at all times.”
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: Yeah, I like this question to start with because a lot of times, most of the time, people are not really focused on that, but more on the performative or the performance or the bodily part. But for me personally, research for a piece starts in the need to be bonding with a certain location. That can be either in a different country or city or just a different place in your own familiar neighborhood. I mean it literally has to do with bonding with the space or with the behavior that is common at that space, in that space, at that location, and therefore I would like to be there physically.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Let's consider it most of the time possible for me to be there physically. And I touch, I feel, I smell, I lick, I, yeah, try to really bond with the walls, the floor, the material that is already there. It doesn't matter if we're now talking about an inside or an outside space or location.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And of course, I like to observe if there are other people around, or other native inhabitants or animals. I tend to be there as often as possible to observe, but initially it's just very broad and also a certain timing is connected to certain spaces and the behavior that is connected with it.
</div>

<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: It also makes me think of instances where you've performed the same work multiple times in different locations. So, this comes to mind for maybe Reframing Conventions where, you perform that in a variety of very distinct spaces. So, outdoors, I think, in a field in Amsterdam South. Then you also perform that work in the Red Light District, and then also in a hotel space where, because of the pandemic, there was no live audience with you physically in the space, but the performance was live streamed.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: That is also a very special work to me because it's my first official piece ever as an artist and it's in the title Reframing Conventions.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Actually, this 2023 is the year that is its 10 year anniversary. So it's pretty cool. I performed this piece lots of times. Initially it derived from my research into the plain office space. Uh, and with plain, I meant really like the… let's say the eighties American box [cubical] offices. That's where my research started.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And then growing out of it, obviously I live in the Netherlands. So, here it got slightly different, but let's say plain office space. For me, the most intriguing part was that, indeed, it started with investigating this space. And then, at one point, I was like, I need to investigate it by putting myself in the field.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And by actually visiting all these locations that I researched and just go there and analyze and explore whatever is going on there because I never had that experience. I'm not sure about you, but I never had the experience of working eight hours. That's a normal workday for us here…to explore eight hours of work behind the desk every five days of the week.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  So I started taking it off like that, and then it immediately occurred to me that people - the first thing they do when they arrive in the office space is take a seat. And the last thing they do is also take a seat most of the time behind a certain type of screen. And yeah, that got to me. And it was really striking to me that people were actually able to do so, to be honest.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  So the beauty of this piece is that…I'll take a big step…is that at that moment I started to focus on the performative way of doing research. [It’s] how I still do it, developing, designing certain performance experiments for myself to try out myself on location in different spaces and then afterwards, integrate those experiences and those moments of feedback or those reactions or those energies you can get sometimes with just people passing by or whatever also being present in the space. And then continuing with the funneling down process, et cetera, until you get a moment of “Ah, this is something interesting!” And that's when indeed after a year or so…a year and a half of research, I finally got to this point of Reframing Conventions and being able to launch it as a piece.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  So I performed this piece immediately quite a lot of times after 2013, after launching it in Italy, a lot of times. And well, it went quite well. And then at one point, obviously other things happen and also you lose your own interest in a way… [It] shouldn't become automatic for me at least. And then in 2020, I just was in lockdown as [was] half of the world at one point.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  I started to really come down to my core of why I did what I do. And then it occurred to me like, ah, this could be so interesting to relaunch now. Or at least, I started to not even think about relaunching immediately. I just figured, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to do just the same time-lapse I did in 2013."
</div>

<div class="guest">
  I'm just gonna do it here. And then I was like, “Oh, but finally, Amsterdam is my playground again. This is amazing.” So I started taking off and also I'm not the person who sits at home for months, you know, I'm just not comfortable. I was like, okay, I'll take the fine. I'll just do everything.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  I'll just find places that I normally would never be able to perform [inside]. I hunted some cool locations and spaces down to perform this piece again free for everybody. And that's how it got rolling. And that's also why I got in the Red Light District, for example, which was very, very special.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And also it had a more political layer because the sex workers were obviously totally not able to work. Let's say not from the Red Light District, not from their studios, so to speak. It got a whole recontextualized layer, which was super interesting and also very special because people finally could find a moment to get out and sneak to me to watch a bit for free and everybody, you know, it was a different energy.
</div>

<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: And for the performance that you did of Reframing Conventions in the Red Light District, how did you feel as you were going through the performance, as you were, you know, going through the eight hours of sitting in the chair…you're behind glass and the audience is on the other side in the street? They're able to watch you. How does that element of voyeurism impact you?
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: It is very interesting, especially with these, like picking out the case of the Red Light District, because indeed voyeurism became more important during that specific performance there obviously, but also it's very interesting because it was such a big paradox from where the piece initially…why it was initially created by me. Because it was mostly…I mean, the fundamental pillar is the body and the bodily conditioning and taking that into account and really experiencing it by myself basically and not for others. And then, at that point, taking it into public space. Indeed, it did attract others and spectators and voyeurs, maybe…or am I the voyeur?
</div>

<div class="guest">
  With this specific moment, I think the heaviness of, for me, of sitting there, because I also changed my work hours to the work hours or like the time that the sex workers and not only ladies, by the way, are present there. So I was there from from eight to two. So I shifted it a bit.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  It really changed during the night. Yeah. Now going back to it while talking to you…It was super intense actually at one point, because guys, mostly men started knocking on the windows, and they… obviously people saw that there was a light on or something going on. And I didn't even use red light, I chose my own light for that moment. But that apparently didn't matter. It was just a really intrusive feeling at one point. Yeah. Quite intimidating. And I was even behind glass and there were only now, let's say, I guess, 20…20 moments of strangers doing something or passing by or like walking back like…Wow, it was just so astonishing for people to see somebody sitting there at that moment in time.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  It really got me thinking like, wow, this is so unsafe. Actually, it felt really unsafe. And police even passed by and got the flashlights in my space. It was a change of energy from daylight people, really enthusiastic and proud and curious to raw, which totally represents what the Red Light District is.
</div>

<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: Your comments make me think of another question, which is just how do you negotiate that idea of safety when you're devising performances? Because in almost really every case, you're putting your body through extreme circumstances or situations. And so when does that question of safety come up for you? And is it an issue that you address beforehand or yeah, just how does it come up if at all?
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: Hmmm…Yeah. Safety. Interesting, huh? It's a very interesting term to me, actually, because indeed it's like, yeah, we all know it's that…and I think it's really beautiful about a certain type of… Safety for me is, it's so based on a feeling, and so based on just a change of energy. 
</div>

<div class="guest">
  But in terms of safety, on the other hand, I also really like to challenge my feeling of being safe. And let's say being safe now, meaning feeling comfortable and really secured and really confident and not vulnerable at all. No, those are all things I tend to challenge and I tend to question and I do that via many ways.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  But also, I mean, I think it's visible and people experience it when they are present during a life performance of mine. So maybe I'm having a hate / love relationship with safety.
</div>

<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: Yeah well absolutely. I think part of your work is about testing your own physical limits to almost delimit where your body begins and ends and to understand how it operates, how it functions, how your internal organs are in tune with each other, and I think so much of that comes through with your My Body series or My Self series.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: Uh, yeah, this is the start of the My Self series. So in 2015, I launched this piece and it was actually…I started researching the self and the identification process.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  I realized, okay, yeah, yourself, just be yourself. Okay. “Being yourself.” What the fuck does that actually mean to be honest, huh? I mean, it's actually a universal convention. That's what we created, but I think we don't even know what it means. And it's like, people are happy when you say that to a person, and I'm like, well, what are you happy about? You know? So I started to investigate that.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And the first piece that came out, eventually it was My Self, the Fetus. And for me, the biggest insight during this research was “Je est un autre” (or “the I is someone else / I am someone else”) Arthur Rimbaud…he stated that and simply said the “I” is created through the other people's vision on us.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  So I started to realize that and it was such a moment of liberation as well. And after researching a lot more and conceptualizing that, I realized that…after a few years, you start to even lose maybe a sense of who “that self” might be. And I don't even know, it's the research. So I don't offer conclusions or answers, but I tried at least to show that process during this five-hour performance in fetal position because the vision [of the self] already starts in the womb.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And that was actually what I corrected in the piece after - My Self, the Other, because it's not about the vision. That's not when the identification process starts. It starts with hearing when we don't even have vision, because we don't in the womb. So I started to correct myself also in this series, constantly performing it multiple times…I guess at least 10 times…also in different years, so different ways of being.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And the beauty is that I tried to create or show certain steps I took in my process during these five hours…or not “show.” I like to make people or spectators experience, if I do this live, what I'm going through, because what I'm going through is what you are going through.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And the material I make is indeed based on the loss of the self in a certain way and the awakening of, and maybe the liberation of…because it goes from liquid to fixed to cracked. And that is for me, um, a way to represent this concept and also what the other people's vision on me [feels like] when I'm laying there in exhibition space…but also represent the loss of the self in terms of the shredding of the skin.
</div>

<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: And I think that piece also demonstrates so much of this process of identity formation, which is a process I think that you are troubling or that you are challenging through your work and through the series. That the self - there is no fixed self…the self is constantly in flux and changing.
</div>

<div class="host">
  And so much of our sense of self is determined from without…it's the people who we’re around and their perception of us that influences how we come to understand ourselves and how we come to interpret our body. And that also shifts, of course, with time. So it's just interesting to think of you performing My Self, the Fetus multiple times over multiple years.
</div>

<div class="host">
  The other thing that I think is so apparent in your work is the influence of philosophy and then also biology as well. And I think of the biological a lot when I look at My Self, the Body, and My Self, the Bladder. At the center of the performance is your body. It's you - you're naked, you're oiled.
</div>

<div class="host">
  I believe in the original performances of these works, you were also bald at the time. And in The Body, you lie on a table and you use stethoscopes that you have manipulated and reproduced to amplify the sounds of your organs. And your performance of The Bladder is quite similar. There's a stethoscope that's on the floor and I believe a stethoscope that's on your pelvis.
</div>

<div class="host">
  And as you're moving, you're urinating, you're able to amplify both the sound of the liquid as it hits the floor and also the movements and motions of your pelvis. How did you go about adapting or using the stethoscopes for those pieces?
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: Yes, well, indeed after My Self, the Other came My Self, the Body because of that insight of focusing on audio as a first moment of identification. And I realized, okay, so in My Self, the Other, I pinpointed the Dutch language to use in the performance. And there are no visuals of that work because it wasn't a visual piece, even though I did [it] live also, I wasn't visually present.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  But then I realized, “Hey, but this is okay.” This is already identifying…this is for me relevant because my mother spoke to me in Dutch and whoever was there…so I was already identified by that, but what is underneath that?
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And also I was searching for [something] a little bit more universal I guess for everybody to connect to or to be able to relate to and identify with. And that's when I started focusing on, okay, what if we're just born or maybe not even yet born, but we're still in the womb, what audio and what communication, do our organs have? Like, how do they speak to each other? Because they need to because it's all so connected. I just started to envision like, wow, what would just a conversation like that be like? What would it sound like? Would I be able to follow it or not? Would you be able to follow it the same way or, you know?
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And it was for SXSW in 2018 and yeah, it took a long time to be able to get those sounds out of my body by not using any software and not amplifying it in terms of computerizing. That is really special for me in this piece because it's analog in that sense. It's direct. It is a live investigation into my internal organs, internal audio.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And I created a certain resonance box of myself, which is different every time because that's one of the standards I have. And also one of the beautiful things in life is that my body probably will be different every time I do this live performance. So, every time my organs will speak, it will be a different conversation, I reckon.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  But the whole process into finding a way [to amplify my organs] because our skin is built to reduce sounds from our little factory that is going on here… So that was a very difficult and tough and challenging job. And I went to all kinds of people, all kinds of places in science. I got all kinds of echo stuff for when you're really pregnant. But the quality of it back then was too low for it. And obviously I didn't want to only hear my stomach. I wanted to hear everything that was hearable. So it took a long time and I'm super grateful for… I'm not going to mention names, but for people who were able to get me steps further.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  The one thing I do know is that a lot of people also said to me, “Oh, that's not possible.” Audio sound geeks. And many of them who I really love working with because I'm also kind of a geek in that sense. Many of them were like “No, I can't make it work, you know?” So it was a long, long process.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And at one point, I started cutting and buying and experimenting and just replacing stuff and going to the Paradiso [in Amsterdam] with the Head of Technics there…just playing around in Paradiso, the pop temple. I did my preview performance for him there just to test if it works. And then at one point I was like “Yes!”
</div>

<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: Just to hear about the process that you went through to figure out how to amplify the sounds of your organs…when I watch the performance online, the sound is so crisp and it is so clear. So I think, you know, you did a brilliant job executing that ultimately. And when I think about the My Self series too, I also connect the fifth performance to My Self, the Fetus. How do you connect to or relate between My First Breath and The Fetus, or do you associate those two works together?
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: Yeah, of course. I mean, they're all sequential and yeah, I definitely connect all of them, but maybe they're all fetuses. A fetus is not one fetus. Like a fetus is also very transformative.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And I think this series also represents different types of fetuses maybe in different stages. And the fetus of My Self, the First Breath, is already sitting up in fetal position, so it's a different, it's like 90 degrees…because the fetus is laying down [in] My Self, the Fetus.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  How I developed it? It is right before the fetus is going through the birth channel…is being born. That's My Self, the First Breath.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  But what is this moment that we're also have to become an individual…because you're coming out of the birth channel for the first time and you have to breathe through your own lungs for the first time because you're not breathing through the cord…through your mother's lungs anymore.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  So it was, for me, it was san insight that this first gasp is magical, which we'll never experience throughout our lives ever again. That is already insane, right? Imagining that. It's still, it's still very important work where I try to reach as good as possible as a grown up person to reach out to that magical first gasp again.
</div>

<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: And how do you think the existing five performances in the My Self series have prepared you for and/or launched you into this new sixth performance that you're developing - My Self, The Unfamiliar Roots.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: I must be honest, I don't really have an answer yet to your question, but the roots, in this sense, even goes underneath. So again, I go to scrape off another layer…sometimes more literal and now a little bit more philosophical or, spiritual, maybe…Also because I've been, I've been thinking a lot and working on and busy with my own roots. I knew that my grandfather was born in Indonesia and that my unfamiliar roots are there in a way…in what way I don't know yet exactly.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Of course, I know some things, but mostly it's still unknown and unfamiliar and I've never been there either and also I have been…I don't want to put it like that, but maybe I should. I've also been suffering from not knowing and like the…how do you call that in English… [speaks in Dutch].</p>
  <p>It's like, yeah, just keeping your mouth shut through generations of generations.</p>
  <p>And also, my mother is an example of a person who also didn't know much and never asked or never dared to ask. I don't know exactly what happened. So I think it's also a period of time to focus on those roots. And for me that goes underneath air and breath. And that's why I have the opportunity now to investigate it.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: So much of, I think what you're speaking about is generational silence and what's passed down from generation to generation and what gets stuck or lost or hidden away, and I feel that so much of this process of developing that work or whatever it becomes or evolves into… it's also that process of excavating, of digging and of moving through your own family line as well.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Lisette Ros: Yeah, exactly. Mm hmm. And that's connected also to the…well, I'm not sure. Yeah. No, I am sure. Of course, it's connected to my… maybe my fascination with blood as well. And with my own blood and trying to use it in a performance already. And, you know, still not daring to use it fully…or what is that, you know, that whole investigation, you're totally right. And maybe even generational trauma? So it's opening up in a different layer, in the roots, literally.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Okay, this is from that same interview that you did with Metal Magazine, where you focused…you were speaking at this point about blood and you say, “My blood, where it comes from, where it has been, how it runs and what it all contains is still unclear to me.” And now hearing you talk about My Self, the Unfamiliar Roots and also family history…there is both the literal, the blood that runs through our veins, but also the information that it contains and the things and the people that it connects us to.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Lisette Ros: Exactly. Yeah.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I know that we are running out of time. I probably already held you here over time. There’s a whole other body of work that I won't even have time to talk about with you now at least. But I wanted to give you space to maybe reflect on your recent residency in Mexico City, and the research that you're currently doing on the axolotl (if I'm pronouncing that correctly). And this is an amphibian that is native to Mexico that does not…or I believe it's extinct now…but it did not evolve.</p>
  <p>And so it always remained in that preliminary state and it never evolved into a salamander. And I'm really curious because I think looking at your work, so much of it is about transformation and evolution and being in that position of moving and being in flux. And so what did it mean for you to learn about this creature that resists evolution in a way, or resists transformation, and how is it informing the way that you're thinking about your work?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Lisette Ros: I mean, how hardcore are you when you're just like “No!” I mean, but I imagine just the creature is like, “Okay. No, I'm just gonna reject participating in evolution. And also I'm also rejecting participating in devolution.” (Is that correctly pronounced?) “Well, I'm just gonna be here in my neotenic state of being and, you know, this is good enough!”</p>
  <p>Obviously, it was good enough for a long period of time because… it was not necessary for the creature for the axolotl to do something else, because it was safe and sound in the mud, in the bottom of Lake Xochimilco.</p>
  <p>And until a certain moment where human beings unfortunately started to eat them a lot and started to build the chinampas in the lake, which is basically the early start of urbanization of Mexico City. And that was also the moment when, well, at a certain time, people started to realize that tilapia fish were very profitable, so they started to breed it in the lake, which was perfect because it was fresh water. And then the tilapia actually ate all the same food and the same nutrition of the axolotl. And also, unfortunately [they] were predators to the axolotls. So at a certain moment, the tilapias also breed very quickly. So now even when going on the trajinera boats over the lake, you see constantly the tilapia fish going on. It's out of control and it has been for a long time. And that's, well, what the biologists and certain experts of the axolotl there said to me personally - that was the reason why they're extinct.</p>
  <p>The beauty of the animal still remains though, because it is able to be juvenile, to keep its juvenile traits, so to speak, because of its fully regenerative power, so it can fully regenerate body parts like a brain, tail, eyes… and it just remains in this neotenic kind of survival state.</p>
  <p>And that's also one of the messages that I formulated in the concept after this research as something that is maybe very interesting. For us, in terms of a different take on the idea of progression. Why are we always speeding up and needing to transform and needing to evaluate? So I'm actually focusing now on the absence of metamorphosis.</p>
  <p>Whereas I came there to find out what the relation to the concept of metamorphosis was, and the similarities to me or us human beings coming from this creature, I'm taking it as a symbol actually. I'm not sure where it's going to go. Now coming back, being back here and going away again [I don’t know] where it's going to head towards, but this message I formulated on the idea of progression and finding other forward movements in a different way is something that's really inspiring to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I think there's also the beauty in that. Maybe the fact that the axolotl remains in that primary state, which makes me think about the fetal state and how, at least through your My Self series, there's this inspiration and investigation of the fetal state and its influence on identity formation and the self.</p>
  <p>And so, it's always connected. Everything's always connected, but it does also seem to be inviting that similar turn of looking back to one's beginnings, which I find really interesting.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Lisette Ros: Thank you. Yeah. Very excited about it.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: As we move to close, Lisette, I wanted to invite you to speak about things that you're excited about that are coming up next, and to also let listeners know where they can follow you and stay updated with your work.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Lisette Ros: Yeah. I am actually going very quickly, like in 11 days I'm leaving to Indonesia for My Self, the Unfamiliar Roots. I'm gonna do a residency there with Melati Suryodarmo, and we've got a freestyle after, and it's going to take up two months. So hopefully enough [time] to find a lead.</p>
  <p>And actually, if you want to keep updated or stay notified about a bit of that process, I share this in my newsletter and that's via MailChimp. You can find, or you can add your own contact info on my website, which is www.lisetteros.com.</p>
  <p>You can find me there and obviously you can find me on Instagram, which is for me sometimes very difficult to post things because of many restrictions and many bans I've had. So it's most of the time, it's probably just a teaser or trigger that you find there. Google is always your answer.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Well, thank you so much, Lisette. And thank you for pushing us all to be more aware of ourselves as we move through different spaces, through different environments and  to check in with our bodies too.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Lisette Ros: Thank you so much. Thank you.</p>
