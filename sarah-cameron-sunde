  <p>Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu. I'll also be your host. In every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn more about their practice and motivations.</p>
  <p>And in this episode, I am so excited and so happy to be speaking with Sarah Cameron Sunde. Sarah Cameron Sunde is an interdisciplinary artist who works at the intersection of performance, video, and socially engaged public art. She creates site-specific live performance works and video works that stretch time and encourage participants and the public to feel the size and scale of their bodies in relationship with the surrounding environment.</p>
  <p>Today, Sarah and I will be discussing her incredible project, 36.5 / A Durational Performance with the Sea, a series of nine site-specific performances and video artworks made in collaboration with communities around the world. In each performance, Sarah and community members stand silently in a body of water for a full tide cycle that lasts from 12 to 13 hours.</p>
  <p>Over this period of time, the water rises to almost engulf participants. On the day that we are recording this episode, we are approaching the one year anniversary of the final performance of 36.5 / A Durational Performance with the Sea, [performed] in the New York estuary on September 14th, 2022. On that day, 175 people joined Sarah in the water at the estuary, and the performance was live streamed around the city, and satellite performances happened around the world.</p>
  <p>Thank you for coming on to the Open Studios podcast, Sarah. How are you feeling today? And how are you feeling about the coming anniversary?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest-info">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: Hi, thank you so much for having me. I'm really excited to be in conversation with you all. And, um, yeah, I'm feeling okay. A little bit, you know, it's, I think it's a…it's a moment to mark what happened last year and [a time] to try to experiment with a few things moving forward. I'm probably leaving a few too many things to the last minute, but it's kind of like a low-key, you know, it's a low-key event. So, I've been texting with my collaborators around the world today, being like, “Hey, you're going to show up? Are you going to stand in the water with me or…meet me in the water?”</p>
  <p>Last year's event was so big, and so, I've been recovering from that all year, and then this just feels like…what I'm doing on Thursday, we're gathering at the Cove with some of the key folks who participated last year. And then, it's open to anyone who wants to come by, and I'll do a couple mini stands for about an hour or so, each one of them happening during the hour and ten minutes when, last year, my teams in Netherlands, Bangladesh, Brazil, Kenya, Aotearoa, New Zealand (all five international locations) were all standing together in the water.</p>
  <p>And that was for me…it was one of the most powerful [moments]. Well, if not the most powerful moment of the performance was just knowing that we were all there together. So trying to reenact that, remember that, hold it in my body in some way. Yeah…it's kind of a weird place to be because, you know, the series is done, but then it lives…I'm still trying to figure out how it lives on, you know, it's all a little bit of an experiment.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah well, especially because you have so many different forms of video documentation of the various iterations of 36.5. I just think, because that was my entry into this project; [it] was seeing some of the video works online and being so moved by watching a collective of people come together to stand so stoically looking out into the horizon.</p>
  <p>The way that the work is really built in collaboration with the water, with the environment. Yeah. It's great that there are these different sort of reverberations or afterlives of the original activation.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: Yeah. I mean, it's so interesting to think about actually in relationship to performance. So I created the works to be these two… I always thought of it as creating two autonomous works of art on the same day.</p>
  <p>Like one was the participatory performance, which is experienced by the people who are live and present and standing in the water. And then the other is this video artwork that will have this incredibly long life. And I have always felt like, like all the people that I've met…I've met you after I did this performance, the last one. And I've, this whole year I've been like, Oh, I wish I could invite you to the performance because I know that the live thing is like the real deal.</p>
  <p>You know…there's the duration of it [which] is what's important. And I've thought, oh man, there's people I'm going to meet in my life and they're never going to get to experience this. Or I've been sad for that, you know, but then I've let go of it.</p>
  <p>I've started to think the new thing that's happening for me is that I've been thinking about “How does the work live beyond my body?” Because I know I'm done with those [performances]. And people ask all the time, like, “Oh, where are you going to stand next?” As if it's a simple thing, and I'm like, Nope, I'm done.</p>
  <p>Like the series is really complete, but there's so many people who find resonance with it. And I've tried this a couple of times. I've had a couple of people who, you know, have wanted to experience it somehow. So I've given them instructions on what to do and given them…my simple prompts and told them to go out there and do it on their own at a certain time of day and then report back to me. And I've had some pretty profound responses to that. And nobody's standing for the whole tidal cycle, but they're doing it for a couple hours or, you know, an hour or so, and are having some real profound moments with that.</p>
  <p>So then part of me is like, Oh, it's okay to let it grow into this other place. And even if someone's doing it on their own, if they know that they're participating in this project as a whole, you can still feel that collective experience. Even if it's not at the same moment in time that we all stood in the water, you know?</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I think that's really exciting because the work then becomes this…ongoing event that's not marked or linked to any specific time or place. It can just continue and what you're allowing people to do is to enter this work through…almost by acquiring this type of felt knowledge. [You’re] giving instructions and giving this score: giving the tools where you can go out to your local body of water and enter the water and stand for, you know, any period of time that you feel comfortable to do so. And by feeling the water and interacting with the water in that way, [participants are] accessing this wider pool of knowledge…There's something very sensorial and tactile about that.</p>
  <p>And I remember when you described one of your first experiences of going to stand in the water by yourself. I think this is probably when you were up in Maine many years ago, and you said that…you felt connected to more people. You felt connected to other parts of the world just by standing in the water.</p>
  <p>So yeah, I think it's really cool that other people can get access to that or gain entry into the work in a way that is really personal for them by doing it themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: Yeah, that's true. That's it. Thank you for bringing that up actually because that's interesting in terms of thinking about…I'm sort of like on the fence about how detailed to be with the instructions or the score because there's things that I have learned that I sort of want to share. But then there's another [instinct]. It's more like, “Oh, how do I just get it so that they feel it?”</p>
  <p>Yeah. You kind of can't help but feel something if you stand in water. It's a strange thing. It's like, it's just something that, you know, we don't usually do. People are usually swimming or playing in water, but standing in water for a long period of time is something that doesn't really happen and [rarely] long enough to feel a shift.</p>
  <p>So, my entire goal in making this work has been: how do I invite people into this experience with me? Because it is profound.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I want to go back to the beginning to a time before you had even conceptualized the project that would become 36.5 / A Durational Performance with the Sea.</p>
  <p>So, Hurricane Sandy hit New York City and the Eastern Seaboard in October 2012, causing unprecedented levels of damage and destruction.</p>
  <p>And I remember at the time when Hurricane Sandy hit, I was in high school on Long Island, and a lot of my friends actually had their homes swept away. My high school was turned into a shelter for a week, and really, life kind of came to a standstill, you know, [in the] days and weeks after landfall.</p>
  <p>And it was after Hurricane Sandy hit New York that you realized that the city could disappear within your lifetime, and in the storm's wake you had physical evidence of how vulnerable our cities and towns are to sea level rise and extreme weather.</p>
  <p>It's been a long time since Hurricane Sandy hit, but can you remember how you felt in the aftermath of the hurricane and how you felt moved to use art to respond to the disaster?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: I remember it pretty well because there are these kind of pivotal moments that shifted my own perspective.</p>
  <p>My husband is actually a water engineer. I don't always tell this story, but he's a water engineer…And he had said to me before, like a few years before Hurricane Sandy (we weren't married at the time). He said, “You know, New York is really vulnerable to the water, right?” And I was like, “Whatever, you know, we're invincible.”</p>
  <p>I really did not pay much attention to what he was saying because I just have always thought of New York as being so powerful. And then Hurricane Sandy happened and I saw…I witnessed it and I understood what he was talking about. The water really is all powerful. So that became this moment of understanding and seeing the problem like I didn't see it before then.</p>
  <p>At the time, I had been working on this other project about survival as an artist, and I kept on imagining this little artist running around the city, trying to make ends meet, and the city is just sinking beneath her feet. I was trying to work that into this other piece I was making with my collaborators.</p>
  <p>And so, I was working on that idea and I kept on thinking about this metaphor. I was like…there's a parallel here between the struggle to survive as an artist or any individual really on a daily basis. And then the struggle for humanity. To survive in the face of the climate crisis and what's happening and sea level rise and extreme weather events.</p>
  <p>And it really was this sea level rise that I was really kind of marinating on and thinking about that in terms of time. And yeah… I just kept [working on it]. It really took...it was nine months, you know, of thinking and working on the idea. I knew when I sort of had this aha moment in Maine and realized that the tides could be a metaphor, I was like, “Oh, that's it!”
  <p>I live for those moments where you're searching, searching, searching…and then you land on it and you know, that's what you have to do. You know, it's interesting how that was such a different time. You know, we have come a long way in terms of the climate crisis. People have taken it in in a really different way.</p>
  <p>I used to see people in 2013 and ‘14 in the beginning, I would see people's eyes glaze over if I said the words, you know, “sea level rise” or “climate change”. I took that out of my language actually.</p>
  <p>And now… I was curious also like, okay, where will we be? You know, if I commit to this series and give myself seven years, which turned into nine years, like where will we be as a community? All these years down the road, will we be in a better place? Questionable, but at least there's more people paying attention now, you know?</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I think it's so much harder to deny the reality that our world is changing, our planet's changing, and that, you know, [the] climate crisis is real.</p>
  <p>When you first began 36.5, there [were] people who still would have said that the climate crisis [or] climate change is abstract. It's distant. It's out of reach, and it's not in any way coming close to or threatening their bodies, which really wasn't true at that time. And certainly, it's not true now. And the, you know, the reality of our changing world, our changing environment, our changing planet is something that we're really forced to reckon with and confront…on a regular basis– no matter where we live now.</p>
  <p>It's a conversation, I think, that’s happening in many more spaces, [and in] many more ways now than perhaps it was when you first began.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: Yeah, definitely. It's still challenging. I still think it's pretty abstract for a lot of people, but it's definitely more on the forefront and…the number of people who are caring and thinking about it is…hugely changed.</p>
  <p>And…sometimes I talk about the project as that…what I am trying to do is make the abstract concrete for people. Like that's what giving the experience of standing in the water is about– how do we feel the shift, the change on our bodies?</p>
  <p>Because we can talk about it intellectually until we're blue in the face. But if we don't feel it in our bodies, how are we gonna actually make a change, you know?</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: What have you learned from the water, or what have you felt or learned or realized?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: Yeah, I mean, it's so interesting, right, because it's so simple and it's so complex. I have learned to have a deep respect for the water and to think of water as a being rather than as a resource or an object.</p>
  <p>I mean, it comes from both the experience of standing in the water and then also the experience that I've had with many of my collaborators around the world who have indigenous wisdom that they've grown up with. And they understand water and their shoreline and what's happening and really have taught me our ocean is alive and and must be cared for and respected and that we have a responsibility to reciprocate everything that water gives to us [and] that the ocean gives to us.</p>
  <p>Also just this idea that it's everywhere…The phrase “water is life,” that is so real. And, you know, the impulse that the project began with of: how do we think, reconfigure, [and] rejigger our relationship with water? Because in New York, we're not, we weren't paying attention. You know, probably a lot of us need to rejigger our relationship [with water] and understand that we are surrounded by water and we are not, as humans, the most powerful thing.</p>
  <p>And how do we have reverence and respect?</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I can just imagine how humbling it would be to stand alone or even be joined, joined by others [in the sea]...to just look out at the vastness of the water. I definitely want to; I want to try to come on Thursday.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: Okay, good. Yes. I want you to.</p>
  <p>Come and stand with me for a little bit. You'll get it. I feel like you'll get it. Yeah. Well, that's the thing that you mentioned is, like when I was in Maine and that first time it was…I think, you know, we know intellectually that we're all connected through the water, but then you feel it in your body in a really different way.</p>
  <p>If you're in the water for an extended period of time, it's powerful. It's powerful to realize how connected we are all from an embodied perspective, not just in our brains, you know.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I feel like there's this beautiful message of survival or endurance. When I have looked at videos of the performance and you see the tide come in and you see the water rise, but eventually time goes by and the water does recede and, and all of the participants emerge.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: The cycle is important, I think. I had some people who said to me, “Well, why don't you just get out when it gets, when it goes high? Cause isn't that the climax or isn't that your point?” And I'm like, no!</p>
  <p>Because it's actually, it's about…how do we stay humble and get through something. To me, it couldn't, it wouldn't work to not go through a full cycle.</p>
  <p>And that reveal, the reveal of the body after having lived through this immensity is really important. There's like a little bit of hope there.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: You emerge changed when you leave the water. Yeah. In every way. So I know that you've performed, and been involved in so many different iterations of 36.5 around the world in the Netherlands, Bangladesh, Brazil, Kenya, New Zealand, Mexico, San Francisco, and, of course, New York.</p>
  <p>It's occurred in so many different places. I'm just curious, how did you begin the process of forming connections with community members who lived, you know, in so many places around the world?</p>
  <p>And what did that process look like of building and performing 36.5 with them?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: Yeah, well, each work has its own long story of how it came to be. So I can tell you, um, if you want to name a place, I can tell you the story of that one.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Maybe, uh, Brazil.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: Brazil. Great. Yeah. So I mean, it all began…every time it was like, oh, I had an idea. Okay, I have to go somewhere in the world or, you know, I was trying to do it once on each continent or in a body of water off of each continent.</p>
  <p>So Brazil was a place that I had thought about because I had worked, I had actually directed the U.S. premiere of a play by Nelson Rodrigues in 2006. Or 2005. That was, I had learned a lot about Brazil. So I was very interested, [but] never had been there.</p>
  <p>And…I talked to a couple people, people hooked…it all was about connections. Like, who do I know that could get me to somewhere where I could actually get an invitation to come? Because as an American artist, I don't ever want to just show up somewhere. I want, you know, it feels really important to make the connections and slowly build those relationships and then figure out how to make it happen.</p>
  <p>And then in Brazil, it was through a colleague who connected with a friend who connected with a friend. I met this artist, Bel Borba, who is a street artist in Salvador. And he, we got on the phone and he was like, “You must come here. You must meet Yemanjá.” Like,  he was just very enthusiastic; and really, he's like, “I can introduce you to everybody.”</p>
  <p>And so Bel was really the first person who convinced me that I should go to Brazil. So this was the one time where I did [go first]. I went down to do a research trip before I did the work. So, but it was only a couple months before. So I went down in late January and early February. It was important to show up in order to make something happen.</p>
  <p>So I went down for the celebration of Yemanjá, which is in early February. Because I was going there, I met Adriana, who is the... the Chief Officer of Resilience for the city of Salvador through another connection of mine from the Netherlands. And I met Clara Domingas, who became my dear core collaborator through an artist who I knew in New York, who was Brazilian.</p>
  <p>And so I just…it really was a process of just, “Okay, I'm going to Brazil. Who else do I know that might be able to connect me to people who could be interested [in this]?”</p>
  <p>Once there's some energy behind something you really can make stuff happen if you try. Because there's always just a few degrees of connection, and you can meet lots of people.</p>
  <p>So anyway, it’s a long story, but I just met…that first trip. I just met lots of people and then understood like, okay, here's the team. And we're going to come back in two months and actually make it happen. And then the team just grows every time the team has started with like a couple core people. And then it just has grown, grown, grown, grown, grown.</p>
  <p>It's like a…it's a metaphor for the rhizomatic nature of the project as well. I remember how we would, we had to take taxis or Ubers there a lot because of the safety factor. But, Clara would get in the Uber to go from the shore where we were to where we were staying. And she would just start telling everybody about the project.</p>
  <p>And that was one of my favorite things was realizing also how, you know, part of me was really sad. I did speak a little Portuguese on Duolingo, but I really couldn't speak the language. And sometimes that would make me sad, like, “Oh, I don't understand what everyone's saying.” But then another part of me thought that this was actually great because it meant that my collaborators took ownership of the work and they were in control of what the story was to their community, which is really important, you know, that… it wasn't just me doing this thing.</p>
  <p>It was us. We were all doing it together. That was really powerful and really important. So it was always, the thing was always finding the people who really wanted to invest in it and do it with me. And then once that happened, it wasn't easy ever, but it was possible. I always had faith we could make it happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: It's astonishing to think about all of the ways that this project…like extends beyond and from you. It's just so wonderful also to look at the different iterations of 36. 5 that have occurred around the world and how, in every location, there's a different way that others are entering into the space, into the water and the different creative works that have happened alongside it: the music and the meditations and the ceremony.</p>
  <p>It's facilitated these different types of gatherings that have occurred in so many places.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: That's really special. Yeah. It's interesting how each one kind of, each work was a work in itself. It wasn't just a like, “Oh, you know, go there and do it again.” Right? Because it is so site-specific. And so, for example, in Brazil, the team I was working with, there was a lot of that initial impulse…[to focus on] the struggle to survive on a daily basis.</p>
  <p>Like that was real for a lot of the people that I was working with down there. The poetry group, Pretxs de Rua, that I still am in contact with, they made it very clear to me that, you know, there was a lot at stake for them every single day. So we really looked at that and the poetry that they performed to mark the passing of each hour; they became the human clock.</p>
  <p>They performed the human clock interventions that became about that resilience, you know, how do we survive on a daily basis and also think about this planet? When I think about each different work and…you can't always see it in the video works, which is part of why I'm trying to…my collaborator, Una Chaudhuri and I are trying to write a book because there's so many more stories that are kind of just living in my body…or in the memories of myself and my collaborators, but I'm trying to record it before I forget.</p>
  <p>There's so many deep, complex moments that I don't want to lose, you know.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I think it's so necessary to almost find a way to transform or record, you know, nine or ten years of your life and of all these different interventions and to have that be recorded as this history.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: I think so. I mean, I don't always enjoy writing.</p>
  <p>So this is…it's been…I need a reason. I need someone to tell me I have to do it in order to do it. But I think it's also in the archive and the gathering of materials and stuff. So I have to just think of it as part of the fun, creative project.</p>
  <p>And it is interesting…some of what you said earlier made me think about how, you know, so much of the project is communication and the connections and the building, you know; it's building slowly towards this kind of epic moment or day.</p>
  <p>And that is, I mean, there's so much. I probably have…I have a lot of archival materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I can only imagine.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: It's just overwhelming.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: So you said in a recent talk at the World Economic Forum Meeting of New Champions in China that 36.5 / A Durational Performance with the Sea almost functions as a rehearsal for the coming discomforts that humans will experience as the water continues to rise.</p>
  <p>How do you think we'll learn to live beside the water as our planet continues to change?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: Shout out to Una Chaudhuri, who is an amazing ecocritic scholar [and] Dean for Humanities at NYU, who I think started introducing the phrase “rehearsal” into our dialogue. She's been a wonderful thinker with me in this work since 2017.</p>
  <p>I think we just have to figure out how to adapt. And the first step towards adaptation really is coming to understand and respect the water in a different way than we do now as a society, as a whole. I think a lot of individuals have deep respect for the water and deep understanding, but it's how do we get that [mindset] into the systems that are oppressing us all in so many ways.</p>
  <p>That's why I'm interested in policy shifts and how artists can be at the table, even though it's sort of tedious. When people are just talking policy, I really can't handle it, but I really love it when you can see someone who works in a different field connect to the work from an artistic lens.</p>
  <p>I think we just, as artists, we have to keep doing work. We need all of us making work that has that respect for place. I think that's what's been so profound for me about working with the folks who are indigenous around the world. These core ideas of gratitude and respect for where you are: asking permission before you take something [and] reciprocity: if you take something, give something back.</p>
  <p>I think if we can live into, and breathe into those ideas, then we might have a chance, you know, at re-imagining our society. And just, but just like recognize, I think so many in this capitalistic world we live in, so many people think, “Oh, well, we can't, how are we going to get out of this? You know, how can we change the systems?” And we just have to change the system!</p>
  <p>And there's great examples. We just have to look to our indigenous leaders all over who have the resilience and the mindset that is so needed– finding creative ways to live with the water and listening to those, that wisdom of respecting and gratitude and reciprocity.</p>
  <p>It's all, it's very simple and yet very complex, but I think that's the key. I really do.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: We touched on hope a little bit earlier, but what gives you hope in the midst of the climate crisis that we're all living through? What gives you hope to continue the work that you're doing and to continue sharing 36.5 in so many different ways?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: I think what keeps me going is people's responses, you know. I'm a sucker for an audience, I guess. I never intended to actually perform this work, you know. I was a director before I did this, and I had made a lot of abstract work that, you know, some people really loved and some people didn't get at all.</p>
  <p>And so there's something for me with this work…I mean, just seeing how it keeps growing and people keep bringing new ideas to it. And it's open enough that it kind of can keep resonating in that way for people; that gives me hope. Like having the responses continue and getting that feedback feels important to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Well, I am so grateful to have been able to, I don't know, come into the work, you know, many, many years later… but still…I found it all so, so very moving and I'm very excited to stand in the water myself in a few days. And, I guess in closing, I wanted to ask you if there's anything else…I mean, there's a whole book-worth of things probably to share about 36.5, but if there's anything else you'd like to leave us with as we close this conversation and also just to let audiences know where they can learn more about you and your work and also 36.5 / A Durational Performance with the Sea?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: I studied theater at UCLA, but I was mostly a director for the first 10 years of my career and then kind of moved towards visual art and performance. Or thinking about that performance from a visual art perspective, but initially as a director and creator of large scale works.</p>
  <p>And then, it's only because I had to do this performance that I became a performance artist. And I still feel kind of funny about that title, because I don't necessarily know if I'll ever do another performance where that is my body.</p>
  <p>I probably will. I have a couple of things in the works, but the thing that I realized, and this was actually with a couple other artists who were on PerformVu (Veronica and GOODW.Y.N. and Raegan and Marilyn Arsem, who's amazing). We were all at the symposium [Raegan organized] and I realized that the important thing for me about performance is that I'm trying to de-center the human experience, even though…we're always going to recognize our humanity through it. But the images that I'm creating are about the rest of the environment.</p>
  <p>In 36.5, it's about the water and how little we are really in the scale of things. And so that is an interesting [realization]. I think I'm just excited about that realization because I feel like it gives me a way to talk about performance that is different. Or like I have a little bit of a mission with that in a different perspective.</p>
  <p>Does that make sense?</p>

  <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah. Yeah. That absolutely does.</p>

  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: We're de-centering the human experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart:  Yeah, and the idea that a performance can be any series of actions of any scale or type and there are these interventions that can occur.</p>

  <p>Sarah Cameron Sunde: And then, yes, the project website is <a href="http://www.36pt5.org">www.36pt5.org</a> if anyone wants to check it out. My other regular artist website is <a href="http://www.sarahcameronsunde.com">www.sarahcameronsunde.com</a></p>
  <p>I have a big plan for a big exhibition that I need to convince someone to produce for me. You know, the six durational video works in two channels each, so a huge 12 channel video installation is what I'm hoping for… planning on for the future.</p>
  <p>And then writing, working on this book, like I mentioned.</p>
  <p>I'm now also finally, after this year of recovery, kind of returning to a couple of my older projects and finding new chapters for them [and] starting a few new things too. So it's yeah, there's a lot going on. It's a busy time and I'm really excited to be on this platform.</p>
  <p>It's amazing what you guys have created and really exciting. [It’s] such a such a great space. So thank you. Thank you!</p>

  <p>Asia Stewart: And yeah, we're excited to be navigating this adventure with you and I'm very excited to see all of the coming projects that you've hinted at.</p>
  <p>Thank you so much for joining us today, Sarah, and I hope that everyone who is listening will take this as an invitation to go stand in a body of water near them sometime soon.</p>
