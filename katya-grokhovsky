  <p>Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu. I'll also be your host. In every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn a little bit more about their practice and motivations.</p>
  <p>And in this episode, I am so happy to be speaking with Katya Grokhovsky. Katya is a multidisciplinary artist who works in installation, performance, sculpture, video, photography, and painting. When I've seen Katya's installations and sculptures, I am immediately struck by their shapes and textures. My eyes have loved to follow the bend of the soft materials and draped fabrics that graze the floor, or dart between the spectacle of colors that enliven a room.</p>
  <p>Born in Ukraine, raised in Australia, and now based in New York City, Katya plays with space, time, and memory in her work, both her own memories and those stored within the discarded and found objects she incorporates into her work. Her decidedly feminist practice celebrates chaos, the absurd, and the grotesque, and explores things related to gender, identity, and labor.</p>
  <p>As much as I would love to discuss Katya's own work today, we will be devoting today's conversation to the Immigrant Artists Biennial, which Katya founded back in 2019. The Immigrant Artist Biennial (TIAB) facilitates a platform of support for marginalized and under-recognized artists. The first edition of the Biennial was publicly launched in 2020 at the Brooklyn Museum and was titled Here Together.</p>
  <p>The Biennial was set to continue across various New York City venues into August 2020, but was interrupted by the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Biennial shapeshifted and evolved to take place virtually and present over 60 artists through online exhibitions, panel discussions, and performances. In fall 2020, the Biennial was also able to present a group exhibition at the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts (EFA).</p>
  <p>The second edition of The Immigrant Artist Biennial will take place this fall and winter, from September 8th, 2023 to January 14th, 2024. Co-curated by Bianca Abdi-Boragi, Katherine Adams, and Anna Mikaela Ekstrand, the Biennial will present 48 artists from over 35 countries across seven venues. The theme for this year's Biennial is Contact Zone, which, of course, reminds me of Mary Louise Pratt's concept of the contact zone.</p>
  <p>[Pratt] introduced the term to “refer to social spaces where cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other…often in context of highly asymmetrical relations of power, such as colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths as they are lived out in many parts of the world today.”</p>
  <p>So Katya, to begin, what does the theme Contact Zone mean to you, and how do you hope the theme will frame this year's Biennial?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: I guess coming out of the pandemic…especially with the Biennial that had to go digital in 2020…mostly digital. We managed to do one exhibition and several events, but in terms of…so now it's the zone of contact. To me, it's a little bit literal, maybe because I'm not curating it this year. This is my curatorial team's ideas, and I really like what they came up with. In my view, it's also quite a human approach, humane approach to just…we want now to be in the zone of contact across borders, across nations, bringing us back together in actual physicality. So, we're really hoping we don't have to go virtual fully again.</p>
  <p>You have some digital events, but we are definitely mostly physical in New York City only this year. And that was the idea pre-pandemic, of course, is to be with each other in these spaces. Exhibitions, you know, events, et cetera, to be together.</p>
  <p>But the first one “Here Together” was named like that way before the pandemic hit. So then of course it took on a completely brand new meaning. Everyone's like, we're here together. But really we were all isolated in front of our screens.</p>
  <p>Contact Zone is also, because we're talking a lot about conflicts going on in the world right now, wars, everything, climate change, et cetera. So there is that idea of, well, where do we actually have contact as human beings? So that's kind of my approach to this theme. But the theme is…they're usually the themes…the overarching theme for the biennial is broad enough. Each exhibition has their own themes and their own artists and their own titles.</p>
  <p>So that's kind of, I look to, you know, the big biennials. Well, not that TIAB is not a big biennial, but you know what I mean. For inspiration, I look to the biennials that have a theme, and then each venue has their own theme, in a way. So under that, you can come up with so much. So I think that was really…that was kind of my prompt to the curators.</p>
  <p>Broad, but specific. Specific, but broad. I mean, you know…</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Also thinking through the challenges and crises that we're currently grappling with and facing in our world… I’m thinking about these collisions and the small collisions that happen on an everyday basis between people of various backgrounds. Like what happens in those moments when we connect and touch or fail to connect or touch and those moments of friction or almost meeting.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: Yeah, exactly.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: So in 2019, in an interview with ArtFuse, you said, “For me, the institution of a biennial inherently symbolizes both exclusion and desirability.” So how have you tried to resist the conventions of traditional biennials to make The Immigrant Artist Biennial feel more welcoming?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: Really good question, because I grappled with that question from the beginning.</p>
  <p>Before even thinking of the term biennial, I was thinking of a platform. What kind of platform can exist for immigrant artists being involved in a variety of programs? As an immigrant artist myself, I based it on my own experience in this country. What did I need? What did other artists that I encountered in my journey need?</p>
  <p>I kept thinking, so there's this idea of the big biennial, which is, of course, the Venice Biennial and Sydney Biennial and all these. Most of us can't afford to go see them or can't be in them. But there’s that desire. It's also extremely economically, you know, just challenging for most of us, really.</p>
  <p>So I thought, well, why not take that big idea and, and do it myself? It's a DIY project. And that's basically based on how I live my life. It's just, well, why not? Um, why not go to America? Why not go to New York City? Why not be an artist in New York City, which is one of the most, you know, cliché, but also challenging and difficult things and decisions I had to make…But it was one of [my] best decisions. And sometimes you have to jump in.</p>
  <p>So, I thought, why don't I test the waters and just see how it plays out? You know, just by virtue of calling it The Immigrant Artist Biennial, it's already sort of staking its territory.</p>
  <p>We're not representing any particular country. It's all countries. You know, there are different ways to be a biennial. Each one, each iteration can change according to the team, the curators, according to how I'm feeling, and what’s going on in the world. It doesn't have to be [one thing]. It's a moving beast.</p>
  <p>We don't have a space I mean, literally it was an idea with a website and an Instagram. I mean, that's how most things start right there. So I thought, well, why not? It can change drastically every single time. And it did because of the pandemic. And now we're sort of going back to more of a traditional model. But again, we partner up with venues. We work with what's already there.</p>
  <p>We're not creating this exclusive platform. Although, of course, we can only show and do so much. Step by step, there's a lot to the process. 2018, basically, when I started even researching and thinking about this and 2019 is [when] the fundraising began and…I would sort of test the waters a little bit. I would ask people, how does it feel?</p>
  <p>I started thinking of the logo and all these little, you know…play it out, see how it feels on the page, see how it lands to people. And some people are just not into the word “biennial” or not into the “immigrant” [part] at all, which [is] still there. That conversation is always there. I can defend it.</p>
  <p>I can say why it has to exist. It's pairing concepts that shouldn't exist together together. That makes sense… just staking, claiming a territory amongst the biennials, right? Without any money, without anything in the beginning. You know, it comes with the territory…anything you [stand by] is a choice. Everything else falls away and you have to stand by that choice.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I'm just so grateful that you created and launched The Immigrant Artists Biennial. One because you're declaring that immigrant artists are here and confronting and going up against these structures and assumptions that exist within the art world that have sought to silence or disregard immigrant artists.</p>
  <p>And then I think the second thing that's so important about the biennial too that you mentioned is its flexibility - its willingness to transform, to mold into different shapes, and also its investment in being accessible and, you know, all of the programming… The events, exhibitions, they're open to the public. You're presenting this invitation to come in and then enter the community and engage with the artists and enter into these different types of dialogues, which is so essential and is not something that you see, unfortunately, from most institutions. And, you know, most biennials that [currently] exist.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: Absolutely. I mean, we make everything free because I, we mostly partner up with venues that are free essentially anyway. I mean, [at] museums…the events that we are part of, like the Brooklyn Museum…[where] it’s part of the First Saturday event, which is a big, famous event, and it's a party essentially, especially for Brooklyn and it's huge. And I feel that's a great way to have one of the events a week. This year, we're doing a panel there on undocumented artists, and it is a free event and it is accessible.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I think that there are so many elements to the Biennial that run counter to traditional biennials. One that you also touched on, which is the idea of resisting the delineation of nationhood and citizenship.</p>
  <p>And I would say most biennials are so closely tied to nations and the idea that artists and their work will represent a nation, often either the country that they were born in, or the country that they now work in, which is, you know, wound up in a lot of confusing ways to citizenship. And so it's really powerful that The Immigrant Artists Biennial leverages the work of immigrants who defy that fixed nature of nation and the restrictive concept of citizenship.</p>
  <p>I just want to ask, Why did you feel, you know, back in 2018, back in 2019, when you were first conceptualizing the Biennial and then fundraising, that it was really important and essential to unite artists showcasing the biennial through their experience of immigration or their status as diasporic subjects?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest-info">Katya Grokhovsky, podcast guest.</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: It's interesting that you mentioned a tie to citizenship and borders and nationhood, which is such a huge part of the Venice Biennial, and that's kind of one of the first biennials. It struck me that a lot of immigrant artists…we could represent anything, anywhere, wherever we really landed. That is one thing.</p>
  <p>And another thing is, immigrant artists often fall through the cracks. I have experienced that through different statuses as I went into this country. And there's always something that you can't apply to. So, it's something [where] you [are] just excluded from the door… or even you can't even knock.</p>
  <p>As you move through, you understand that some doors start opening, and a lot of it comes with economic needs to even have your practice. So a lot of others, from the get-go don't have that access to funding, to grants, to even some residency programs, which to this day have a prerequisite of a visa or status, which I think is ridiculous, unfortunately, but that's where we are.</p>
  <p>Nothing's going to change overnight. It takes a long, long time. So for me to think about nationhood and borders coming from several countries myself and having several attachments to a variety of places in the world, I thought of that…what does that mean to be an immigrant in a biennial essentially?</p>
  <p>Who do we include? Who do we exclude? By virtue of [its title] it excludes people who are not immigrants. But that was immediately kind of baked into the ideas that we had…I want to talk to people who have [an] experience of immigration, a variety of immigration [statuses] who might sort of fall through sometimes.</p>
  <p>This biennial has more exiled artists, more refugees, undocumented artists. We have a couple of second generation artists as well, who also often have that, you know, in-betweenness in their lives, especially in this country. I feel that's a big part of this country.</p>
  <p>In the beginning, the first time, I was very strict because I wanted to establish it as this is a biennial where people are born outside of the States. So, I wanted that conversation [about] language barriers, bureaucracy barriers, systematic barriers, status issues. So to me, what happens there, a lot of emerging artists lose opportunities without even ever being looked at. I've had that experience where I couldn't apply to residencies where I really, really needed a free studio space because [residencies] were only for green card holders.</p>
  <p>I'm not a citizen yet personally, so I have a whole list [of opportunities] where it's only for citizens. That comes with a lot of money. Those opportunities come with a lot of money.</p>
  <p>Recently, I experienced a studio visit with a curator who mentioned a grant. They said, “Have you applied for this?” And I said, it's on my list…when I'm a citizen.</p>
  <p>And it's a shock. To get to those places [takes] an extraordinary amount of time and money and resources. Whilst you're trying to be an artist and years go by. What are the places in between those spaces where we can offer something like a biennial? Where we don't look at nationhood or borders or status, but we do look, [and say] “Oh, you're an immigrant? Let's talk!”</p>
  <p>So it's the opposite. And I've had, what's interesting in the beginning, I've had a lot of people who are, I guess, Americans, whatever that even means, but in terms of coming up to me and saying, well, I want to be part of it. I'm a third generation…I'm a fourth, I'm a fifth. Well, then it's not for you.</p>
</div>

<div class="host-info">Asia Stewart, podcast host.</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And there are so many other windows of opportunities that they could look into…</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: And a favorite thing of mine to say well, you could go somewhere, anywhere else…any other place! But us…we are a DIY biennial that is, you know all grassroots, all hands on deck. [We’re] volunteering our labor and our resources between everything we do. But we don't need to help someone's career if they already have all the access in the world.</p>
  <p>So that, I think, was the whole point.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah, and you're filling in the gaps that these institutions and funders have left, and saying, let's figure out how we can share resources together, how we can support one another, how we can care for one another. I think that that's so special and so, so important.</p>
  <p>And really, it shouldn't be radical, but it absolutely is.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: And that's why sometimes I am shocked by certain questions that I get. [People say] “I'm this and this…why can't I be in it?” And I always say, well, how does it feel…that line of you can’t be in something? Well, think about everybody else. How does it feel to be on the other side where you're not “this and this and this,” and you just don't have access and you don't have resources? What happens then?</p>
  <p>And again, the Biennial is…it's quite a small [project]. I mean, it feels big, but comparing [it to] a lot of things, it's a small project. We can only show so many artists, but we try to at least have bigger conversations, you know, where other artists can come, where audiences can come, where there's awareness.</p>
  <p>I'm already, of course, thinking of the next one. And that's what happens when you're in the midst. We haven't even opened yet, but I'm, you know, because I'm realizing that sustainability as for any artistic venture, as you would know, is a big lift. It's a big mountain and  sustainability is very difficult in this country and in this climate and in this economy.</p>
  <p>So what does that mean for us to move forward and to…on my end to even think [of] sustaining it alongside my practice, alongside everything I do? So, there's always that innovation. I already have lots of ideas of how we can make this so much more kind of bearing weight on the institutions themselves.</p>
  <p>This is going to be [the] second biennial. So, we already kind of have a place. I've done my real [work of putting] rocks on my shoulders lifting it up a little bit. I've done my leg work, especially before the pandemic of securing all these partnerships and fiscal sponsorship, et cetera, and audiences and interest.</p>
  <p>How can we now approach institutions to pitch it and land it somewhere with them where they take a lot of the weight off us? I want to gauge that interest after this one much more on the institutional level.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Mm hmm. And I think [you want] to also hold a lot of institutions to task…right? Back in 2020, with the first edition of the biennial, that was a time when, you know, that summer, that fall, many institutions were making statements claiming to invest in diversity and inclusion and to champion the rights and voices of immigrants. And so, okay, you've said that. Now, prove it!</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: I wanted to attract the right partnerships [with organizations] who are looking to talk to immigrants, who are working with immigrants, and I know them all around the country now. And they come to me and we talk and we're partnering. And that's exactly what I wanted. It doesn't mean they're all visual arts based…because immigration is the broad subject.</p>
  <p>I wanted to know all these programs and these fellowships and anything that supports immigrant artists and undocumented artists, et cetera, because I realized there's such a big gap and many missed opportunities in these big institutions. And I agree with you. There's a lot of statements being made consistently, but do they follow up consistently? No!</p>
  <p>I would love to see more funding and more very specific conversations based on immigration [at] institutions around the country, because it's constant. And what I think we're going towards especially is climate migration. That's just going to happen. It's already happening. How do we deal with it?</p>
  <p>With this, and I mean, it's also an art biennial…we can show art. But, I'm definitely involved in maybe more of a humanitarian part of it, right, because I am a humanitarian, and I have experienced all these stages [of immigration], and I know a lot of different people who have.</p>
  <p>So, how can we harness all of this into a bigger conversation? It doesn't have to be [having] all these immigrant biennials everywhere, but just programs or programming. And I think that was my whole point with it. Well, we’ll do our biennial, [and] maybe there's going to be more. And I don't know if you follow the news with the Venice Biennial? It's about immigrant artists, the next one: foreigners.</p>
  <p>So, you know, I just wanted to mention that I did look into how you apply as an organization for the Venice Biennial. It costs a fortune. Basically, [it’s] a fortune turns out…even as a non-profit. I mean, it's incredibly expensive. So, [we’ll be there] guerrilla style, maybe?</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah, just show up!</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: I mean, we have a flag of the biennial, so I'll just wave it.</p>
  <p>And it's so incredibly difficult because they actually have an Open Call right now for organizations. I didn't realize there's a barrier to even, you have to put down a deposit to I think even be looked at. To even apply. Thousands of euros. I mean, we're talking [the cost of] a house! Maybe [I’ll get] a ticket to Venice one day next year, I don't know.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And [do] some street performances, maybe!</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: Absolutely.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: You reminded me of many of the unique programs that the Biennial has been able to sponsor and support through partnerships. So there's just one that I wanted to highlight. Back in the first edition of the Biennial, the Biennial partnered with the Center of Art Law to offer a low-cost immigration clinic that gave artists consultations and insights into the O-1 visa application. Do you have any plans for there to be similar programming this year? And what would that look like?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: We haven't yet partnered up with them specifically. We might again. I started a resource page on our website, and the Center for Art Law is there and many others, but we are now partnering this year with a new initiative…They also just started [and are] called International Arrivals.</p>
  <p>Just like us, it's a DIY project, with an artist and curator. But they are doing podcasts with some of our artists starting with me. That's part of their whole project to interview artists from places of conflict. And so they're based on war in Ukraine and many other conflicts.</p>
  <p>But for us, it's also these artists that might need press. That's one of the things that we do in the Biennial. We always have media sponsors who are also artists or our friends and this year it's CultBytes and Art Spiel. And so, with Art Spiel we're going to be doing interviews, which we did with all of our artists last time (also with Art Spiel).</p>
  <p>I went through the O-1 visa [process] several times and [the] green card process, et cetera. So, I know how much press you need [for those applications]. And this is legitimate press. You know, respected community blogs and press.</p>
  <p>And, from that, we hope [to] get more press, of course…bigger and bigger. But in terms of how we operate, I'm always open to conversations. People approach me all the time for exchange and platforms.</p>
  <p>You know with podcasting, let's do it. I've been wanting to podcast with our artists, but we just do not have the equipment or capacity. So, when someone comes and says, “We actually do podcasts,” I thought, “Oh my God, this is the perfection we've been looking for because then we can [offer artists] a podcast as a legitimate opportunity. Like what we're doing right now! I listened to a lot of podcasts, so it's part of our zeitgeist right now. So why not?</p>
  <p>So, that's going to happen. They're going to do quite a few interviews. And with me, [my episode] just came out recently before the launch. And so, I think this year we're focusing on providing media [to] artists.</p>
  <p>We, of course, if there's ever a letter that we need to write, I sign those things all the time. I can recommend, of course. But, I can’t do everything and we can't legally help ourselves, but we can always refer [artists to legal professionals]. I have referred others to the Center for Art Law and to other law groups that we know or to lawyers I have worked with who are immigration specific.</p>
  <p>If there’s anything they need, we can at least do all the introductions and kind of be [a connector]. I know how absolutely daunting, scary, and isolating [this] bureaucratic system is. You feel so scared. To have people who've gone through it and who are going through it themselves say, “It's okay. You have time.” is so important. Because I remember how it was for me. I feel that's just a humanitarian part of the biennial…to be kind of open with that.</p>
</div>

<div class="host-info">Asia Stewart, podcast host.</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: What's so special is that the Biennial then really functions as a community for the organizers, for the artists who are part of the Biennial, and [it fosters] that sense of resource sharing.</p>
  <p>Again, it's political in a way, right? The idea that offering artists a platform, ensuring that they can get media and exposure and connections, that then relates back to their visa applications, which gives them security, which allows them to build the life that they want to live and create more work and just have that foundation… it's all connected.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest-info">Katya Grokhovsky, podcast guest.</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: You realize [that] when you need support, especially as an artist, and especially coming from somewhere else. It's just very simple. It's that basic level of “Who do I ask about this form? I don't understand the language.” I don't understand bureaucracy in this country, which is extreme. It's a sport. The American sport is bureaucracy…that love of [the] bureaucratic process…It’s also very, very, very misleading.</p>
  <p>It's quite bad. I have to ask people, I have to ask my American friends sometimes “So, what does this mean? I still don't get it. What do I have to do? Tell me about this country.”</p>
  <p>We need support and we need other people who have been here, who immigrated a long time ago to be on board, to be like, “Oh, I can help you. I, as an artist, I've gone through this grant or I've gone through this system or, you know, I've done this this way. Why don't you do this? Let me introduce you to this place.”</p>
  <p>So I think for me, those programs that do exist are very crucial. And that's why I started the manual too, because I actually felt not enough support is available and not enough conversations and understanding.</p>
  <p>When people ask you, “Oh, have you done that program?” You say, “I can't, they won't allow me even to apply because I don't have the right status.” That stops people in their tracks and they just kind of walk away without caring or it doesn't matter to them but to you it's such a shame.</p>
  <p>And you feel like, “I'm trying! I'm trying! You know, I'll get there.” But what happens if it’s taking years? So that's my kind of issue with the art world. You know, let’s be more open in all sorts of ways.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And you're providing structures and resources that help people get around those loopholes and trapdoors to find a way to survive.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: To me, it's that gathering as well. It's important. In the beginning, I wanted to do a lot of food based fundraising dinners and all sorts of things. And then of course, the pandemic hit, so none of that happened.</p>
  <p>Still one day, I’m hoping to do some kind of [dinner] because it's such an immigrant thing, but it's also such a human thing. [Even when] language falls apart, we [can] eat together, right? That was so important to me and I'm still thinking of those performances or those events where we can all eat together, but that's something that was just the gathering point.</p>
  <p>It is that zone of “let's contact,” but let's also talk critically about what's being made by artists from different places living in this country. That's kind of the basics.</p>
  <p>I'm not going to say it's perfect and there's a lot of issues we face and a lot of mistakes [we’ve made] and a lot of, you know, missteps and that's just the nature of the beast.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Well, I would say, in my opinion, what you and your team has done with the Biennial is incredibly, incredibly impressive. I want to return to this 2019 interview that you did with ArtFuse. In that interview, you were asked what you envisioned for the future of the Biennial. And, of course, this is before the first edition [happened] before the pandemic.</p>
  <p>But you responded, “My future vision for The Immigrant Artist Biennial is to eventually find a home for it in one of New York City's major museums, and for it to have its own permanent, physical, notable place on the world's cultural map.” So would you say that this previous vision of the future of the Immigrant Artist Biennial aligns with the current goals that you have? And if I asked you that same question now, what do you envision for the future of the Biennial? How may your answer change?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: It's interesting because, of course, in 2019, I could not predict anything in terms of the pandemic. Who knew? And it really changed how I kind of perceive [the Biennial]. Because I think my idea of the Biennial…with everything that happened [it] really sort of took a different form.</p>
  <p>While it could be digital, it could be anything else. It doesn't have to have an extraordinary amount of money and extraordinary amount of support to be a good project, which is the case in my own practice. I do a lot of my own DIY projects, but I think with the Biennial, I really was striving because of the word “biennial.” I was striving for regional institutional support, which of course with a new project is incredibly difficult to get.</p>
  <p>I tried my best and, and I think I basically went through my whole art practice and went back to institutions and places where I felt supported and where I felt they could support this project. And I was right. And I think I'm very grateful. Something like NARS Foundation, where we're having a group show, were one of the first supporters [and the foundation] remained a partner because I'm an alumni, right?That's it. It's that simple. And I've been there. I've had a studio there. I've curated there. I've exhibited [there]. I've performed [there]. I mean, I've done a lot with the NARS Foundation.</p>
  <p>Then EFA Project Space - I'm a studio member at the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts, but way before I've exhibited at the EFA Project Space, I knew the place for a long time and I've been really wanting to work with the gallery because it's such an experimental, beautiful space and the ethics of the space really spoke to me.</p>
  <p>So I think that that was the way I approached it. It was kind of, let's come down maybe from the blue skies, let's place this in the biggest museum ever from the get-go. That's just not going to happen. But let's just walk around the city with the idea and see who responds. Slowly, it might get to the point where an institution might want it more permanently or even [to host] one biennial, but [that’s] not the goal anymore. </p>
  <p>I think the goal is to sustain it. I think when you start something, you're just thinking, “Let's start. Let's establish it.” But, just like anything, sustainability is actually harder. So I think, for me now, I would like to have more institutional support.</p>
  <p>But, at the same time, I'm very careful who, where, how [to partner with]. I think that will take time. We actually have all these venues interested, and I would like to keep that going for the future. But, as I mentioned, I do have all these ideas now for 2025, because I feel there's a greater interest in the Biennial now, and a lot of others are interested in being in it.</p>
  <p>So I keep thinking, how can we expand the conversation? And I think definitely going national is one of the goals…international at some point. I've always understood from day one, but again, the pandemic killed a lot of the travel conversation. </p>
  <p>I've given lectures on the Biennial in different places around the country, mostly in the universities. I give a lecture often, more often than not, that the gallery in that university would be interested in. That's something that I keep in mind. Well, you know, that university was interested back in 2019. How can we access their resources for 2025? And I'm talking about universities because of [their access to] resources.</p>
  <p>Of course, New York is the base. I'm also really wanting to have academic institutions here [involved]. We will be talking to some. Often when you have universities, they need time. Same with museums. With museums, it could be a five year ahead conversation. I don't mind. A biennial is, you know, it's fluid, so it's in flux. If the next one is all around the country in different institutions, that’s totally fine with me.</p>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And it eventually gets to a point where it is self-sustaining.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: That's exactly right. So sustainability, at some point, a couple of biennials in this place or in [that] place, and at some point, [it will] land somewhere. Of course, as any artist, I'm a big dreamer. I dream up these scenarios of it having its own venue.</p>
  <p>But you have to think that way too. To then step back and think, “Well, what can we do now?” I never, never put anything out as “That's impossible.” Because being an artist is impossible from the get-go. If I'm being an artist in New York City right now, maybe things are not that impossible.</p>
  <p>I mean, I don't care. That's how things are built, right? You think that way. So, people laugh at me sometimes. Just, you know, I don't care. That's something I never cared about because that's also a very immigrant thing to do…Like, you have to, what is it, take a leap of faith?</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: The only way I think you can build something is to dream of the multiplicity of ways that it could exist and then you chase it.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: And then along the way real things happen. I think that's what happened with this Biennial. So did I think I would be here? No, because this biennial feels almost like the first iteration because it's mainly physical [and in-person]. So I would think the second one would have been a bigger one already, maybe [with] more of our institutional support.</p>
  <p>It’s difficult because I think it's been three years now of trying to reestablish, trying to repartner, trying to kind of reorganize, and get the team back together.</p>
  <p>I think moving forward, I [will be] much freer once we do this.</p>
  <p>In thinking ahead and going maybe bigger, at the same time, [it’s important to be] maintaining some relationships. Because I like to build and maintain. That's really crucial. And having new curatorial teams and new innovative ideas. I'd like to be part of what is happening in the world, because this biennial is political really, and essentially it is based on what's happening.</p>
  <p>And this one that we're launching in September is based on conflicts. It is based on, you know, the global situation. Um, I think the next one will be more based on climate. And also, you mentioned care. That's something that's extremely important to me. [It’s] becoming more important in my life, but as an artist especially, we need to be cared about and cared for.</p>
  <p>And just as humans. And as human artists, right? Sometimes people forget we're human beings. So I think for me, the next [biennial] would even have “care” somewhere in the name. You know what I mean? That's something that's really important and I, and I'm interested in who's going to be… it might be surprising who wants to be on board with that.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Absolutely. Well, Katya, thank you so much for your time. I want to leave you with one final question, which is just, is there anything else that you'd like to mention about the Biennial before we go and how can listeners follow news or updates about The Immigrant Artist Biennial online?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: We are very close to launching the 2023 Biennial Contact Zone. Our launch event, and it's really a launch party will happen at PS122 Gallery on the 8th of September with a live performance by Yali Romagoza, who's also part of the PerformVu community, and who is a TIAB alumni of 2020. And so, I asked some alums to come back to have continuity and to kind of reopen the next [biennial]. And it's a way for us to all connect and maintain that community. And so, Yali will be performing, I will give a speech, and there will be video works - a selection of video works from some of the artists this year.</p>
  <p>We then go into all these different shows and events through the fall and part of winter. There are about four group shows. I mean all over and [at] different places from non-profits to commercial galleries to the Brooklyn Museum this year as well. To stay up to date, I think the best [method] is Instagram. The Immigrant Artist Biennial Instagram - definitely follow us! We put all the events there.</p>
  <p>We also have a website: www.theimmigrantartistbiennial.com where all of our programming is now online, all the dates, everything's there, all the artists, et cetera. And we'll be updating as we go with news and press, so always [check in]. We also have a newsletter that we are restarting very soon again, so you can sign up.</p>
  <p>I wanted to say that we are getting a lot of emails from artists asking “How can we be part of it?” Of course, it's all curated right now. It's been in the process for two years. So I would say [look out for] the next one in 2025.</p>
  <p>I do not know what's going to happen at all. We haven't, I mean, we haven't even opened this one, so we're fully deep into opening this one, but I would say, stay tuned.</p>
  <p>Just follow our Instagram, come to the events, meet us, meet the others, meet the team. Go to things, and see what interests you. That's part of just being an artist in general, but that's also part of [what] the Biennial is: gathering. Stay tuned for all the good things happening.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: We will definitely stay tuned, and I just want to say congratulations to you, Katya, and to the rest of your team for organizing what I'm sure is going to be an astonishing biennial this fall and winter. I'm so grateful to be able to have the opportunity to go to many of the events and openings, and I hope that many listeners take up that opportunity.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
  <p>Katya Grokhovsky: I hope so too! Thank you so much for having me. Thank you.</p>
