<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu, and I'll also be your host. Every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn more about their practice and motivations.</p>
    <p>This episode is going to be slightly different. I'm joined by Indy Sanders and they are the founder of PerformVu. Welcome, Indy. Hello!</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: How's it going?</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah, I'm doing pretty well today. You know, not too hot, not too muggy. Can't complain. How are you?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: Good. Yeah. Just preparing for New York storms that I think are coming very soon.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Ah, yes, yes, yes. Well, Indy, could you tell us a little bit about yourself?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: Definitely. So yeah, Indy Sanders is my name. I was born in London. I actually left school at 13 and spent much of my teenage years on the international tennis tour. So that's on the junior circuit and the professional circuit. Those days of playing tennis came to an end, sadly, due to a pretty severe back injury. But I found myself able to go to university, I studied politics. From there I drifted around in the law scene for a bit, had ambitions to be a barrister, but decided to move paths. I took a few jobs in the world of tech and found that although I really liked the skills that I was using in that environment (and just tech generally kind of gave me a bit of a boost) I didn't necessarily feel that I was giving enough impact to the world around me. So I wanted to be a bit more intentional with where I put my energy and where I focused my career. So that was kind of where I was at when I started looking for a new project and stumbled across the problem set that led to PerformVu being developed.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Okay. Okay. And what is PerformVu?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: Yeah, so PerformVu is the digital home for experimental performance. It's a space where audience members can explore, watch, and support experimental performance generally, including the artists and the video content that they produce through their incredible work. And we're launching from the 6th of July.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Amazing! And, for listeners who aren't really familiar with performance or experimental performance, what does that mean in your mind and how do you define it?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: Yeah. So, an artist called Natacha Voliakovsky said this really well recently, [they] said that they use performance to deliver a message. And I think that's really interesting. The idea of turning lived experiences, whether that's anything from, uh, gender, sexuality, race, or living through COVID and that kind of whirlwind that we all went through and turning that into a performance and using movement, um, either the artist's own body or other performers that the artist is working with, using materials, using sculpture creation, and all of those sort of different disciplines to deliver that storytelling, I think is, yeah [that’s] probably the best way for me to explain it…that's my take.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah, I absolutely agree. And I think what separates performance art from other disciplines is the fact that the body is at the forefront of the work. The body is the medium through which the artwork is built and created and often shared as well.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: I think it's just really exciting. You know, we've got some awesome work that we're showcasing. You have anything from a queer ballet to someone doing something in the glacial landscape of Norway, or someone doing something in a studio space with an audience live and they're kind of engaging with the audience. So I think it's really cool that it spans across loads of different spaces and interpretations and mediums. It's really exciting stuff.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: And as you mentioned, you have had a pretty eclectic career and background. So what motivated you to create PerformVu? Could you tell us a little bit about that story?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: Yeah, so I guess probably good context to land here as well is that you and I are married. And you're an incredible, you're an incredible performance artist. So, my experience of being surrounded by you and this world of experimental performance gave me exposure to a few key problems within that landscape.</p>
    <p>Firstly, artists are constantly having to apply for grants in order to produce work, and those grants don't cover the cost of living. So you've got artists that are doing incredible work that are still working three jobs on the side just to make a living to put their art out there. You also have this kind of localized landscape of performances happening in some key cities around the world, but if you live on the outskirts of those cities or, you know, far away from them or in different countries, you don't get access to the work that's being produced, and that's a problem.</p>
    <p>And then the third one is, you know... all these artists are performing live, or they're performing for a camera, and they produce this incredible video work, but they don't know where to put it. They can put it on existing solutions, like Vimeo or YouTube, but it doesn't necessarily connect them to the audience that they desire. And most importantly, it doesn't compensate them in the way that we would want it to. So those are the problems that were uncovered.</p>
    <p>And I remember specifically that you and I were on a phone call one day, I was walking up a very steep hill in the U.K. And I remember thinking, why doesn't this exist? Why don't we create it? And that was a while back, and it took us a little pathway to get here.</p>
    <p>I started building [this] properly last year, and have since been, you know, full time on this for a good few months now. And you've come on full time as well as Founding Artistic Director, and we've got a really awesome team around us that's driving a few different areas.</p>
    <p>And yeah, I think it's just been really, really exciting. And despite, you know, the lack of sleep that we've had in the past few weeks and months, we've been able to speak to incredible artists all around the world and hear their stories, which is kind of the purpose of this podcast, just to get those stories out there. But it's so inspiring and it's really energizing and I'm really happy that we're driving this forward.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: And, if you, you know…In your, in your ideal world, what could PerformVu grow to be, or what would PerformVu achieve?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: Yeah, so I think it's really important that we pen the motivation or…the one liner is [we’re] creating the digital home for experimental performance. And that's really important to differentiate [us] from just being a streaming platform or a video platform because we have so many ambitions beyond just delivering video content that you'll start to see kind of trickling through releases in this summer on the tech and later this year. So what we see it to be is just a space to grow that community and connect audiences that are all around the world to artists that are equally all around the world, to share work, to share experiences, to potentially have some kind of deeper connection [than] what we can have right now. I won't give too much away around what exciting things we're working on but, [better connecting artists and audiences is] kind of the main goal. And ultimately we want to create a model that prevents artists from having to work three jobs.</p>
    <p>My dream would be that PerformVu gives a baseline sustainable income to artists. Maybe they need like one job on the side or maybe that's enough. And that would be incredible for us. Because think of how much more work could be created. How much more work could be shared with the world. And the impact and the ripple effect of those stories just getting out there could be huge.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: I absolutely agree. I mean, I think from my perspective as an artist, at times my practice feels incredibly unsustainable because I'm doing 5 different things on the side in addition to attempting to create work in addition to attempting to show up for live performances. And there's also so much time that's required to just, you know, think and live and move through the world and imagine what other performances or works could be to you. So this sounds like it could be something that's, you know, really transformational for the community.</p>
    <p>And could you tell us a little bit about some of the challenges that you've encountered, in trying to launch PerformVu and get it off the ground?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: I think there's three key challenges. First one is funding. Uh, this, you know, we've got some funding through the door now, but this was self funded for a long time. So with that, you've got to think really tactically around where you can put the money that you have. And what's really important to the early stages of the development. So, that was a bit of a challenge.</p>
    <p>Second one is infrastructure. I think tech infrastructure, I won't get into too much detail here, but, two things are really a priority there. One is speed. How do we make sure that the streaming experience and the video delivery is really high quality across anywhere in the world, so you can be sat in Antarctica and get the same speed as if you're in New York with us. And so, we've been focused on that and that's been a challenge to overcome. </p>
    <p>The second one on that kind of lens is security. So what we heard from a lot of the artists that we're speaking to and I know this is an experience you had yourself (and you actually exposed [this] in one of your recent performances) is this, this kind of [illicit] download of content and that's because it's sitting on platforms at the moment that aren't dedicated to enjoying art and [protecting] this performance work. They're dedicated to a load of different [creators]. Different work, different videos, so the dilution of content means that these platforms are not actually prioritizing the work itself and prioritizing protecting it. So that was really important for us to make sure we didn't repeat [that]. So we have a really good base point in terms of security of the work and we're, in the next three months, we're going to have a next level of that. So that's been something we've had to deeply think through and have the structure around us and build that out.</p>
    <p>I think the third challenge is just [connecting with our] audience. So our ambitions for this is to expand the audience for this work beyond the “in the know” community. We would love and will be welcoming on the “in the know” community, the people who are engaging with these performances in their cities, [and] in their day to day lives. But the next [question] for us is how do we create an accessible platform for the people that haven't come across this work [before]? This work is inaccessible because of that localized issue I stated earlier. So, people like myself before I met you Asia, [people] who didn't have exposure to this work, wouldn't know where to find it, don't know the names of any artists [can’t find this performance and video work].</p>
    <p>That's a problem that exists for so many people across the world. But when they get exposed to it, suddenly they're hooked. Like me, I've now, you know, created my whole career around this work. So we feel pretty strongly that there's a lot more people out there like that. And we want to make sure we're building with a focus on bringing them into this space. And that's, uh, that's an ongoing challenge we're going to face, but we're already making good strides towards it.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: I'm really curious…what hooked you? So you were, um, as you said, you know, before you met me, you didn't really know that much about experimental performance or performance art. Maybe you went to museums, you know, a few times a year or so, but it wasn't something that you were fully immersed in. So what is it about performance, about experimental performance that really draws you in, that engages you?</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: I think it's the impact of it, which stems from the stories it's telling, right? We're surrounded by so much content, particularly digital media in the digital media space, right? Suddenly we have so many people trying to tell us things all the time, but so often it's just meaningless. And you scroll through TikTok, you go on Netflix, and you can watch stuff that's enjoyable, gets your serotonin levels up, but doesn't spark much questioning within yourself, or doesn't give you insight into something that's been a lived experience of someone else around the world. So I think that was the real trigger for me. It was like, wow, this stuff is so powerful. These artists are doing incredible things and I want to help them.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Really interesting. I'm also curious too, do you find that there's any relationship with your professional career as a tennis player that draws you or connects you to the experience of putting on a work that takes so much from the body? That that draws from the body…A lot of the performances that you've seen over the past few weeks, months, and years require such levels of endurance and discipline and demand so much from the body as well.</p>
</div>

<div class="guest">
    <p>Indy Sanders: Yeah, that endurance factor is definitely there. I think, you know, tennis players, [or] any athlete has to know their body so intimately, and there are certain signs that you can understand and learn to understand. You know when to push, know when to hold back, uh, and I think, you know, when you go through a six hour tennis match and you come out the other side, you've learned so much more about yourself, and you've challenged yourself to new limits that you hadn't pushed to before. So I think that through experimental performance work, particularly the endurance stuff, you really see that, you see that coming through.</p>
    <p>You see the artists testing themselves, learning, uh, and you kind of, when you're watching it as well, you go on that journey with the artist, even though your body's not in that same space. So, I definitely see a lot of that in, [or] as a parallel. And I also just see like, you know, hustle culture. Tennis players, athletes are constantly hustling, constantly working to improve, constantly fighting for the next opportunity on the tennis court. And you see that in artists as well, I think. You know, the determination that artists have to get their work out there to the world despite all these problems that we've spoken about is pretty impressive.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
    <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah, absolutely. It's difficult. It's difficult out here being an artist, but I'm hoping that PerformVu can change some of that, right? And can make a substantial difference in the lives of the artists who are part of the community and also for the discipline as well. It'll be really interesting to see how users and subscribers engage with the platform to even go so far as to tip the artists for the work that they've seen and hopefully enjoyed as well.</p>
</div>
